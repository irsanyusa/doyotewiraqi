It's often reached for as an accessible lubricant during masturbation. However, this practice comes with several risks and downsides worth considering:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>1. It’s hard to clean off</h3></p><p>Because it is not water soluble, it is hard to remove from the body or sex toys. Vaseline and lotion could linger on the skin or inside the body, even with regular washing with soap and water. This difficulty in cleaning can contribute to the risk of infections, as remnants of the jelly can harbor bacteria.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>2. Causes adverse skin irritation and infection</h3></p><p>One of the primary concerns with using Vaseline as a lubricant is its potential to trap bacteria. Being an occlusive substance, petroleum jelly creates a barrier on the skin, which can trap bacteria and lead to bacterial or fungal infections. The genital area's warm and moist environment is already prone to such infections, and using an <a href=# id=5f31f815-60ae-469c-9af4-a7c8e55ffcfc data-link-role-code=influencer_awards_open_new_tab rel=nofollow>occlusive</a> agent like Vaseline on your sexual organ can cause irritation, infections, and other health concerns.</p><p>Some lotions also contain alcohol, preservatives, and perfumes, which may cause dryness, redness, and swelling.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-a52e4cfd-f773-47f8-9f72-01b8d7e8a99f data-caption="Why lotion is a bad idea when masturbating [istockphoto]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/6pKktkpTURBXy82MWRlNTM1YTI0Nzk0NTdmN2Q3NzYzYWM0NzgzM2Y3Ny5qcGeRlQLNAmTNAZjCww></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>3. Makes condoms weaker</h3></p><p>If you use vaseline or lotion and then masturbate, it can cause the condom to be weaker. This situation is even worse when you use it as a lubricant on your penis before sex. It can weaken condoms, compromising latex and rubber-based materials and reducing their effectiveness as a barrier against STIs and unwanted pregnancies.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>4. Possible Chemical Irritants</h3></p><p>Although Vaseline is marketed as a gentle product suitable for sensitive skin, some formulations of petroleum jelly may contain additives or fragrances that can irritate sensitive skin areas, including the genitals. Individuals with sensitive skin or allergies may experience reactions ranging from mild irritation to more severe dermatitis.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>5. Long-term Skin Health Concerns</h3></p><p>Regular use of substances like petroleum jelly on the skin can interfere with the skin's natural breathing and moisture regulation processes. Over time, this can lead to changes in skin texture, increased susceptibility to irritation, and other dermatological concerns. While the research on long-term effects is still evolving, the potential for such issues warrants caution.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>So what should you use?</h3></p><p>Whether you are masturbating or actually engaging in intercourse, you should use water-based or silicone-based lubricant; you can also use natural oils, like coconut and almond oils. These are more hypoallergenic and skin-friendly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2BmrdStsGaglZa5tbSObmSrnZGovK%2B%2FjKacp2Wjnby2uMNmqq2noGK6or%2FTrqmbmaSeu6h51qKroWWmlsCmuMinnGaZnpl6rbvToqanq1%2BXhrrE0mlu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
