Janet Mills said at a Friday night news conference.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Like many people I’m breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that Robert Card is no longer a threat to anyone,” Mills said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">April Stevens, a Lewiston resident who knew one of the victims, said she was relieved to learn that the “monster and coward” who inflicted so much pain was no longer a danger.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m relieved but not happy," she said. "There was too much death. Too many people were hurt. Relieved, yes, happy, no.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck said Card was found at 7:45 p.m. near the Androscoggin River, about 8 miles (13 kilometers) southeast of where the second shooting occurred Wednesday evening. He declined to divulge the location but an official told The Associated Press the body was at a recycling center from which Card had been fired.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The official was not authorized to discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mills said she had called President Joe Biden to alert him that Card was dead.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Tonight we’re grateful that Lewiston and surrounding communities are safe after spending excruciating days hiding in their homes,” Biden said in a statement. He added that “Americans should not have to live like this” and called on Congress to take action on gun violence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AP23299128443465.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The deadliest shootings in Maine history stunned a state of 1.3 million people that has relatively little violent crime and had only 29 killings in all of 2022. In Lewiston, the 37,000 residents and those in surrounding communities were told to stay in their homes as hundreds of police officers, sheriff’s deputies, FBI agents and other law enforcement officials swarmed the area.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Card, 40, of Bowdoin, was a U.S. Army reservist. Leo Madden, who said he ran Maine Recycling Corp. for decades, told the AP that Card worked there for a couple of years and nothing about him stood out. Madden said he didn’t remember when Card was employed or whether he was fired or quit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last summer, Card underwent a mental health evaluation after he began acting erratically during training, a U.S. official told the AP. A bulletin sent to police across the country shortly after the attack said Card had been committed to a mental health facility for two weeks after “hearing voices and threats to shoot up” a military base.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A U.S. official said Card was training with the Army Reserve’s 3rd Battalion, 304th Infantry Regiment in West Point, New York, when commanders became concerned about him. State police took Card to the Keller Army Community Hospital at West Point for evaluation, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the information and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Wednesday, Card attacked the bowling alley first, then went to the bar. Police were quickly sent to both locations but Card was able to escape. For the next two days authorities scoured the woods and hundreds of acres of Card's family-owned property, and sent dive teams with sonar to the bottom of the Androscoggin River.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Law enforcement officials had said they hadn't seen Card since his vehicle was left at a boat ramp Wednesday shortly after the shootings.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hours before Card's body was found, the names and pictures of the 15 men, two women and 14-year-old boy <a href=#>who died</a> in the shootings were released at a news conference.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The&nbsp;<a href=#>victims of the shootings</a>&nbsp;include Bob Violette, 76, a retiree who was coaching a youth bowling league and was described as devoted, approachable and kind. Auburn City Councilor Leroy Walker told news outlets that his son, Joe, a manager at the bar and grill, died going after the shooter with a butcher knife. Peyton Brewer-Ross was a dedicated pipefitter at Bath Iron Works whose death leaves a gaping void in the lives of his partner, young daughter and friends, members of his union said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Maine Educational Center for the Deaf said the shootings killed at least four members of their community.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prior to finding Card's body, divers searched the water near a boat launch in Lisbon, and a farming business in the same town. At points throughout the day Friday, police vehicles were seen speeding through several towns, lights flashing and sirens blaring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AP23299028528805.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A gun was found in Card’s car, which was discovered at a boat ramp, and federal agents were testing it to determine if it was used in the shooting, two law enforcement officials told the AP. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Authorities have said publicly that the shooter used at least one rifle. They have not released any other details, including how the suspect obtained the firearm.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Authorities found a suicide note at a home associated with Card on Thursday that was addressed to his son, the law enforcement officials said. They said it didn’t provide any specific motive for the shooting. Authorities also recovered Card’s cellphone in the home, making a search more complicated because authorities routinely use phones to track suspects, the officials said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Cards have lived in Bowdoin for generations, neighbors said, and various members of the family own hundreds of acres in the area. The family owned the local sawmill and years ago donated the land for a local church.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Family members of Card told federal investigators that he had recently discussed hearing voices and became more focused on the bowling alley and bar, according to the law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. When he was hospitalized in July in New York, Card had told military officials he had been hearing voices and said he wanted to harm other soldiers, the officials said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Authorities had banned hunting in several communities, in a state where it is immensely popular. However, following confirmation of Card’s death, a public safety alert was issued that announced: “The search is over for Mr. Card. The caution is over. Hunting may resume.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Lewiston shootings were the 36th&nbsp;<a href=#>mass killing</a>&nbsp;in the United States this year, according to a&nbsp;<a href=#>database</a>&nbsp;maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2Jtg3iEjqaYoqaVYsCpu86toKefXaq9pa3Tnqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
