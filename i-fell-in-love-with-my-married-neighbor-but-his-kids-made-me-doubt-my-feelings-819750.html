She wanted to&nbsp;hear our audience’s opinions on&nbsp;her complicated issue and was ready to&nbsp;face any judgment that might come her way.</p><p>She began her letter by&nbsp;saying, “I’m 35, and nine months ago, I&nbsp;went through a&nbsp;messy and painful breakup with my&nbsp;fiancé. I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;moving in&nbsp;with a&nbsp;friend and her husband, and we’re all renting a&nbsp;house together. That’s when&nbsp;I met my&nbsp;neighbor, who I’ll call Kevin. He&nbsp;helped&nbsp;us move our stuff&nbsp;in, and&nbsp;<strong>I immediately fell for him</strong>. Since we&nbsp;both live in&nbsp;the suburbs and work in&nbsp;the city, we&nbsp;started taking the same bus daily.”</p><p>She continued, “<strong>I&nbsp;knew from the beginning that Kevin was married and had <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a></strong>. He&nbsp;talked about them a&nbsp;lot and showed me&nbsp;pictures on&nbsp;his phone and their Facebook account. But it&nbsp;didn’t stop me&nbsp;from liking him. At&nbsp;first, it&nbsp;was just an&nbsp;innocent, silly crush.”</p><p><h2>She couldn’t help but start falling for him even deeper.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ed0/91f/7c85d95bc08aba2287970f7bdb.jpg><p>The woman said, “Kevin is&nbsp;a&nbsp;really good-looking, funny, and sweet guy. The first time we&nbsp;rode the bus together, he&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;about my&nbsp;job and my&nbsp;life. <strong>He&nbsp;was genuinely interested in&nbsp;what&nbsp;I was saying</strong>, which is&nbsp;something my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;never did. We&nbsp;argued about that a&nbsp;lot.</p><p>Kevin is&nbsp;always doing nice things for his kids, like bringing them treats and little gifts. One time, he&nbsp;spent the whole bus ride to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;the phone with his young daughter, comforting her before a&nbsp;big school presentation. <strong>Seeing how caring and attentive he&nbsp;was made it&nbsp;easy for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;picture how wonderful he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;with me&nbsp;if&nbsp;we&nbsp;were together</strong>. ”</p><p>She added, “I&nbsp;just knew Kevin and&nbsp;I could become something more. Not long after&nbsp;I started having feelings for him, I&nbsp;found out that his wife went to&nbsp;the same school as&nbsp;me. That was surprising because <strong>they’re total opposites</strong>. He’s funny and lively, while she’s very serious and dull. He’s not the intellectual type, but she’s extremely smart. I&nbsp;couldn’t help but think that their <a href=# title=personalities data-link=tag>personalities</a> didn’t match at&nbsp;all and that Kevin might be&nbsp;stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> just because he’s such a&nbsp;nice guy.”</p><p><h2>One day, Kevin needed a&nbsp;favor and asked the woman for help. She didn’t hesitate to&nbsp;say yes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fc/16e/fce13a5b9abd7885fdb6309889.jpg><p>The woman got emotional about how things developed. She wrote, “One evening, Kevin came over and asked if&nbsp;I could <strong>babysit his kids for a&nbsp;few hours</strong>. I&nbsp;agreed right away. He&nbsp;explained that his wife was in&nbsp;the hospital in&nbsp;another city, and he&nbsp;was super worried, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;drive there to&nbsp;see her. Since they don’t have any family nearby, he&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;look after the kids for a&nbsp;few hours until a&nbsp;family friend, who was driving from far away, could get there later that night.”</p><p>This is&nbsp;where things started to&nbsp;go&nbsp;downhill. The woman revealed, “<strong>Kevin’s kids were an&nbsp;absolute nightmare</strong>. He&nbsp;has three daughters, and the oldest was a&nbsp;classic bratty preteen with a&nbsp;difficult personality. She was rude, didn’t respect&nbsp;me, and argued about everything. I&nbsp;even caught her muttering insults at&nbsp;me&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times. The middle girl was super loud and insisted on&nbsp;playing noisy, messy games, no&nbsp;matter how many times&nbsp;I told her to&nbsp;stop. The youngest one was sweet and quiet on&nbsp;her own, but she quickly got sucked into the chaos her sisters were creating.”</p><p>She continued, “Eventually, I&nbsp;gave in&nbsp;and played hide and seek with the younger girls. But somehow, <strong>I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;locked out of&nbsp;the house</strong>. When I&nbsp;went around to&nbsp;the back door and asked the oldest girl to&nbsp;let me&nbsp;in, <strong>she acted like she didn’t hear me</strong>&nbsp;and just put on&nbsp;her headphones. Luckily, Kevin’s family friend showed up&nbsp;a&nbsp;few minutes later and let me&nbsp;in. After that, I&nbsp;headed home.”</p><p><h2>The woman is&nbsp;now feeling conflicted about everything.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba2/6b2/da0549525c9a78cdee4b1c8ca1.jpg><p>She wrapped up&nbsp;her story, saying, “The whole babysitting incident bummed me&nbsp;out. Before that, <strong>I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;dream about possibly being a&nbsp;stepmom</strong> to&nbsp;Kevin’s kids someday. Now, I&nbsp;don’t want anything to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with those horrible kids. But it&nbsp;also makes me&nbsp;think that Kevin and his wife must not be&nbsp;happy together, because <strong>kids from a&nbsp;happy family wouldn’t behave like that</strong>.”</p><p>The woman went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;say, “I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with Kevin, but&nbsp;<strong>I don’t know if&nbsp;it&nbsp;can happen because his kids and&nbsp;I just don’t get along</strong>. Plus, their mom could easily turn them against&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;truly love Kevin and believe we&nbsp;could have an&nbsp;amazing relationship. But what happened with his kids has left me&nbsp;shaken. I&nbsp;wish&nbsp;I had someone to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;about all this, but&nbsp;I feel like everyone&nbsp;I know would just judge&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Relationships with neighbors can be&nbsp;tricky, just like with family. A&nbsp;woman contacted&nbsp;us for advice after her neighbor asked her to<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>stop running in&nbsp;the neighborhood</strong></a>. What’s more, the reason behind the request made her second-guess herself and the thing she loves most.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZussSlo2ahnmK5sMLEZq6irJhiurp5zJqpq6GVmXqvscign5unomKvtsCMoaCsZZuesbR5zJqbnmWdmnqlu9Sbq2alqWKzprHLoqWgq11tfnqDlGlm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
