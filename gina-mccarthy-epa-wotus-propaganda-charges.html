But on Thursday, she also said she would change the agency’s promotion policies after the Government Accountability Office said the EPA illegally engaged in “propaganda.”</p><p>“I think the word ‘propaganda’ is always construed as something horrible,” McCarthy testified at a House Agriculture Committee, adding that the EPA disagrees with GAO’s conclusion that the agency broke the law.</p><p>McCarthy said she didn’t mean to “minimize” the <a href=#>GAO report</a>, but she added, “I disagree that it was a problem.”</p><p>At issue is the EPA’s controversial Waters of the United States (WOTUS) final rule, which was published last year with protest from most Republicans and some Democrats.&nbsp;In the rule, EPA extended its authority to waters that have a “significant nexus” with the “navigable” waters.&nbsp;The rule also includes a 4,000-foot buffer zone around those waters, which has led opponents to call the rule a “power grab.”</p><p>In October, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a stay on the rule.</p><p>McCarthy acknowledged at Thursday’s&nbsp;hearing that&nbsp;there is&nbsp;a blurred line between a federal agency&nbsp;informing the public about regulations and illegal lobbying and propaganda. The&nbsp;GAO said EPA’s promotion of its WOTUS&nbsp;rule on social media crossed the boundary. McCarthy disagreed, saying&nbsp;agency officials felt they were appropriately following guidelines set by the Office of Management and Budget. OMB is now working to clarify social media guidelines, she added.</p><p>But McCarthy also pointed out&nbsp;that&nbsp;the agency wasn’t lobbying members of Congress.</p><p>That prompted Rep. Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio) to respond, “You were lobbying the people who lobby us.”</p><p>Republicans have said that in Iowa, the rule would give the EPA authority over about 97 percent of the state’s land.&nbsp;Opponents also say it&nbsp;could lead the EPA to regulate very small&nbsp;water supplies, including farmers’ ditches and man-made ponds. The rule includes exemptions for agriculture, but Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) said he isn’t convinced that a few carve-outs will undo the additional red tape the rule creates.</p><p>The EPA’s promotion during a public comment period is worrisome, Gibbs said, because it’s a particularly controversial rule. During a comment period, an agency&nbsp;is supposed to be listening to stakeholders about their concerns. The “propaganda” ruling by GAO “goes to the integrity of the whole comment period process,” Gibbs said.</p><p>Committee members piled on.&nbsp;Rep. Rick Crawford (R-Ark.) said it was “obvious that you were trumpeting your own views and not taking into consideration the public’s views.”</p><p>Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-Tenn.) criticized that “nobody was punished” for the social media activity.</p><p>Rep. David&nbsp;Scott (D-Ga.) called on McCarthy to “come clean” and admit the EPA was in the wrong rather than continue to defend its practices.&nbsp;“You broke the law,” Scott said. “It needs to be admitted. It needs to be recognized. And furthermore, you spent taxpayers’ money in the lobbying.”</p><p>Scott was the only Democrat to voice concerns specifically about the EPA’s use of social media, but other committee Democrats criticized the agency more broadly.</p><p>The WOTUS rule&nbsp;was a main focus of a hearing in which&nbsp;members from both parties&nbsp;criticized&nbsp;the agency’s&nbsp;relationship with landowners and state governments. They said the EPA&nbsp;hasn’t acted cooperatively and imposed&nbsp;mandates instead of leaving regulation to states.</p><p>Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) said the agency has a “gigantic tone problem,” and the public considers EPA rules as punitive rather than protective.</p><p>Rep. Tim Walz (D-Minn.) asked McCarthy to show more “regulatory humility.”</p><p>And Rep. Trent Kelly (R-Miss.) described the EPA’s attitude as, “I’m smarter than you and I’m right and you’re wrong.”</p><p>Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified Rep. David Scott (R-Ga.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hha3xxfo5qaGifmaOubrnCnJirrJiueqa8wGauqKylqHqxvs6pmKCZnpmubq%2FHmqmgnaNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
