However, this ideal scenario does not apply to&nbsp;everyone and, in&nbsp;fact, there are some celebrities who have also had to&nbsp;fight hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;enjoy the happiness of&nbsp;holding a&nbsp;baby in&nbsp;their arms. Whether it&nbsp;was through insemination, adoption, surrogacy, or&nbsp;even naturally, several celebrities have fought hard to&nbsp;become mothers. And if&nbsp;you’re thinking that it&nbsp;was because they were too old to&nbsp;have children, you’d be&nbsp;wrong.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side,</strong> we&nbsp;have made a&nbsp;compilation of&nbsp;13&nbsp;celebrities who gave their all until they fulfilled their dream of&nbsp;holding their own baby in&nbsp;their arms.</p><p><h2>1. Beyoncé</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b9/957/8b6868504da1f26cd1a0a6c06e.jpg><p>Known worldwide for her countless hits and her great ability to&nbsp;sing and dance, there was a&nbsp;private side to&nbsp;<a href=#>Beyoncé</a> that she revealed a&nbsp;few years ago. Back then, only a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;her closest friends and relatives knew that she had been trying to&nbsp;conceive without success. Before she had her daughter Blue Ivy, the singer and businesswoman confessed that she had suffered a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;miscarriages. She expressed feelings of&nbsp;frustration and the desire to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother. She also <a href=#>said</a> that in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother, she had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through a&nbsp;process according to&nbsp;which she had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more considerate with her own mind and her body first. Then, she felt she was ready to&nbsp;bring her daughter and her twins into the world.</p><p><h2>2. Kim Kardashian</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8a/b13/3c996557008f05a9fbb71d9dc5.jpg><p><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>’s case was a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular one. Her problems arrived only after she had a&nbsp;normal <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a>&nbsp;— when her daughter North was born, in&nbsp;2013. When trying to&nbsp;give a&nbsp;little brother to&nbsp;her newborn baby, Kim and her partner, Kanye West, began to&nbsp;face some complications. The singer claimed that she had complained so&nbsp;much about her first pregnancy and that she had never imagined that she would have to&nbsp;pray to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again. The first pregnancy left <a href=# title="Kim Kardashian" data-link=tag>Kim Kardashian</a> with a&nbsp;retained placenta (<a href=#>placenta accreta</a>), which required multiple surgeries and left a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;her uterus. After much effort, she was able to&nbsp;conceive little Saint, but turned to&nbsp;<a href=#>surrogacy</a> to&nbsp;have her last 2&nbsp;children, Chicago and Psalm.</p><p><h2>3. Alejandra Espinoza</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/515/712/1b87c15e528feb8547a2474905.jpg><p>The Mexican-American beauty queen, model, and&nbsp;TV presenter was extremely candid about the battles she had to&nbsp;fight in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother. Alejandra Espinoza <a href=#>told</a> Univision that she suffers from a&nbsp;condition called <a href=#>thrombophilia</a>, which prevented her pregnancies from reaching a&nbsp;safe term. After several treatments and 3&nbsp;miscarriages, she was finally able to&nbsp;welcome her son Matteo in&nbsp;2015.</p><p><h2>4. Mariah Carey</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=#>Mariah Carey</a>’s case, things were slightly different. It’s a&nbsp;known fact that the singer waited until after the age of&nbsp;40&nbsp;to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;conceive a&nbsp;baby for the first time. Since age was then a&nbsp;factor that played against her, the singer underwent several <a href=# title=fertility data-link=tag>fertility</a> treatments, which did not work immediately. Later&nbsp;on, she had to&nbsp;face a&nbsp;<a href=#>miscarriage</a>, several unsuccessful attempts, and even <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a> problems. The singer also confessed that during pregnancy, she suffered from <a href=#>gestational diabetes</a>, <a href=#>pre-eclampsia</a>, and had to&nbsp;receive <a href=#>progesterone</a> for weeks to&nbsp;reduce her chances of&nbsp;a&nbsp;miscarriage. She finally welcomed her twins in&nbsp;2011.</p><p><h2>5. Nicole Kidman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b83/f69/7b8fc5505ba02559ab6279b264.jpg><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;alternative methods of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;parent, <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> might be&nbsp;familiar with more than a&nbsp;few. During her early career period, when she was married to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a>, the couple opted to&nbsp;adopt 2&nbsp;children. Kidman later confessed that she had suffered 2&nbsp;miscarriages at&nbsp;the time. After her divorce from Cruise, Kidman became a&nbsp;biological mother for the first time with her new partner. But bringing her second baby into the world was an&nbsp;<a href=#>ordeal</a>. The actress described her experience as&nbsp;a&nbsp;roller coaster ride full of&nbsp;disappointments, pain, and grief, which is&nbsp;why her second daughter came into the world via surrogacy.</p><p><h2>6. Brooke Shields</h2></p><p><a href=#>Brooke Shields</a>’ life hasn’t really been a&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;the park, and not even motherhood gave her a&nbsp;break, but fortunately, this story has a&nbsp;happy ending. The renowned model and actress <a href=#>fought very hard</a> to&nbsp;become pregnant with her first daughter. It&nbsp;was only after 7&nbsp;attempts at&nbsp;in&nbsp;vitro fertilization and a&nbsp;spontaneous miscarriage, that she was finally able to&nbsp;become pregnant with her first child. In&nbsp;the end, Shields and her significant other were able to&nbsp;become the proud parents of&nbsp;2&nbsp;baby girls, one in&nbsp;2003 and a&nbsp;second in&nbsp;2006. It&nbsp;should be&nbsp;noted that her second baby arrived naturally at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;41.</p><p><h2>7. Céline Dion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/306/a9a/8bf9b65e43833ef067ce827187.jpg><p><a href=#>Céline Dion</a>’s struggle was hard from the very first moment she decided to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother. The singer and songwriter and her husband, the late Rene Angelil, finally welcomed their first child in&nbsp;2001 after several attempts at&nbsp;in&nbsp;vitro fertilization. However, conceiving a&nbsp;second child was much more difficult. After <a href=#>6</a>&nbsp;failed attempts at&nbsp;artificial insemination and a&nbsp;miscarriage, the couple was rewarded with not one, but 2&nbsp;babies. Céline Dion’s twins were born in&nbsp;2010 and you can just see how happy she is&nbsp;with them.</p><p><h2>8. Giuliana Rancic</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca3/36e/a42923565fab9f5091e97defd3.jpg><p>If&nbsp;anyone in&nbsp;the world has been open about their fertility problems, it’s been&nbsp;TV presenter <a href=#>Giuliana Rancic</a>. The American celebrity decided to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother and underwent a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;fertility studies, but the result that came back was far from any expected or&nbsp;happy news: she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Not only that but because of&nbsp;the disease, the popular&nbsp;TV host lost the possibility of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;mother biologically. Nevertheless, she refused to&nbsp;give&nbsp;up. Rancic hired a&nbsp;<a href=#>surrogate</a> to&nbsp;have her first child. She didn’t stop there, she wanted a&nbsp;second child but then the surrogate carrying her baby, unfortunately, suffered an&nbsp;<a href=#>unexpected miscarriage</a> and Rancic has not tried again since.</p><p><h2>9. Halle Berry</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b4/007/de8b555f84841f676ce1784c52.jpg><p><a href=#>Halle Berry</a> was convinced that becoming a&nbsp;mother was just part of&nbsp;her destiny. But fulfilling her dream proved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>harder</a> than she expected. The actress and entrepreneur confessed that she kept getting negative pregnancy tests and finally, after about 35&nbsp;tests, she got a&nbsp;positive result and her first daughter was born in&nbsp;2008. Surprisingly, she became pregnant again at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;47, when she was expecting menopause. Her second child was <a href=#>born</a> in&nbsp;2013. In&nbsp;the end, she might have been right all along: she was destined to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother and she’s doing great.</p><p><h2>10. Gwyneth Paltrow</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ee/4e3/d9b9cf599fb8a0a71b137b57e3.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a>’s case, she carried to&nbsp;term the pregnancies of&nbsp;her first 2&nbsp;children with her then-husband, Coldplay’s front man and pianist, Chris Martin. However, when they decided to&nbsp;have their third child, things changed. According to&nbsp;the actress’ <a href=#>confession</a>, she suffered a&nbsp;miscarriage that, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;being emotionally devastating for her, almost cost her her life due to&nbsp;medical complications. After this experience, the actress and entrepreneur still wanted to&nbsp;have more children, but she was a&nbsp;bit afraid of&nbsp;trying. Besides, she felt that her moment had already passed. Eventually, Paltrow and Martin divorced and she doesn’t seem to&nbsp;have any plans of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;mother again any time soon.</p><p><h2>11. Chrissy Teigen</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/978/4bc/1c21ea5f88b9dd67a14c5aff65.jpg><p><a href=#>Chrissy Teigen</a> has managed to&nbsp;break the taboo of&nbsp;infertility in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> by&nbsp;sharing her own experience. Her confession required a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;courage, but it&nbsp;was important. She <a href=#>said</a> that at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;her marriage, she had to&nbsp;accept that she and her husband, John Legend, were having a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;difficulty conceiving a&nbsp;baby. And all that despite having visited several specialists and undergoing various treatments. Otherwise, they would have been parents for the first time 5&nbsp;or 6&nbsp;years ago. The couple finally managed to&nbsp;have their first daughter in&nbsp;2015, through in&nbsp;vitro fertilization and, after several failed attempts, their second baby was <a href=#>born</a> too. The couple announced that they were expecting their third child in&nbsp;2020, but, unfortunately, Chrissy <a href=#>suffered</a> a&nbsp;miscarriage.</p><p><h2>12. Sarah Jessica Parker</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d6/577/3a1db7569f867c7f26c412ecc1.jpg><p><a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> became a&nbsp;mother in&nbsp;2002, when she had her son James. However, later&nbsp;on, the actress and her husband wanted to&nbsp;give their son a&nbsp;little brother, but they kept <a href=#>facing</a> many problems when trying to&nbsp;become pregnant. These difficulties did not cease for many years. At&nbsp;some point, it&nbsp;even seemed like the actress simply would not get pregnant again. But in&nbsp;the end, and after taking into account that the chances of&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful in&nbsp;vitro fertilization were decreasing given her age at&nbsp;the time (she was already over 40&nbsp;years old), <a href=# title="Sarah Jessica Parker" data-link=tag>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> opted for a&nbsp;surrogate to&nbsp;welcome her twins in&nbsp;2009 and now she’s a&nbsp;happy mother once (or&nbsp;twice) again.</p><p><h2>13. Halsey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa3/845/0d9eb55260806518630f339b54.jpg><p><a href=#>Halsey</a>’s case is&nbsp;even more peculiar because the singer is&nbsp;barely 26&nbsp;years old, but she has already gone through a&nbsp;hard struggle to&nbsp;get pregnant. The singer and performer recently <a href=#>revealed</a> that she is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the midst of&nbsp;her pregnancy, without minimizing the fact that she had already suffered a&nbsp;miscarriage just before a&nbsp;concert and, even&nbsp;so, went on&nbsp;stage to&nbsp;perform in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;not let her fans down. The star has also said that she is&nbsp;fighting a&nbsp;battle with <a href=#>endometriosis</a> and has had to&nbsp;undergo several “terrifying” surgeries. Her baby is&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;be&nbsp;born in&nbsp;mid-2021. We&nbsp;wish her the best of&nbsp;luck!</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know of&nbsp;anyone who has also fulfilled their dream of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;mother after a&nbsp;very hard struggle? What was it&nbsp;like in&nbsp;your case?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH50ecKeo56aop7BqrHSZq6hp12owbPBxqCjnpxdqbxursScpqadXaK8rr%2BMm6ytZZSesa%2FAjKyrqKhdqru1tctmq6GdqWK6orDEZqCtZWhlfnKBlmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
