Known for its groundbreaking portrayal of the surfing lifestyle —and its theatre run in New York City where it sold out for 48 straight weeks — the film remains a significant piece of sporting cinema history.</p><p>Following the screening, Papa Salt will host an afterparty featuring live performances from two acts from the SXSW Sydney Music Festival lineup: Colombian psychedelic funk band <a href=#>BALTHVS </a>and Australian electronic artist <a href=#>Touch Sensitive.</a></p><p>The event will mark the debut of Papa Salt’s new product, the Papa Salt Paloma, a premixed gin cocktail.

There’s no big company behind us, we self-funded the whole thing,” chief executive Charlie Maas said at the event. “And one of the reasons we took six years to get a product out is that this is truly a labour of love.</p><p>“Everyone knows London’s got incredible restaurants and bars,” said Robbie. “And I don’t think people really know that about Australia as much. I think people still think of Australia and think of Foster’s, which, by the way, you can’t find in Australia. We have so much more to offer – the food and beverage scene in Australia is actually incredible. It’s so underappreciated outside of Australia.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images-r2.thebrag.com/var/uploads/2024/08/PapaSalt-1024x683.webp alt width=1024 height=683 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Papa Salt Sydney event is part of SXSW Sydney’s<a href=#> week of free programming</a> at Tumbalong Park.
