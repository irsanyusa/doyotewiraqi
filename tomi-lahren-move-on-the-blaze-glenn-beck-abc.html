Lahren said that she was then <a href=# rel=noopener>fired</a><b> </b>by The Blaze and filed a wrongful termination <a href=# rel=noopener>lawsuit</a> against the media company and its owner <a href=#>Glenn Beck</a>. But The Blaze <a href=# rel=noopener>said </a>that it still employs the <a href=# rel=noopener>24-year-old</a> commentator . “It is puzzling that an employee who remains under contract (and is still being paid) has sued us for being fired, especially when we continue to comply fully with the terms of our agreement with her,” a spokesperson for the Blaze said in a statement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lahren spoke out publicly on television for the first time in an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> with ABC’s <i>Nightline</i>, which aired this week. There, she asked Beck and his company to <a href=# rel=noopener>let her go</a> as she says she is no longer allowed on air. “I get up in the morning and I don’t have a job to go to,” she said. “To my former employer I would just say let me go.” She continued, “Let me move on.” Lahren admitted, however, that Beck’s company is still paying her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m deeply hurt by what has happened, but if this is the way that it is, let’s just part ways cleanly. I just want to work and have the freedom to put my voice out there,” Lahren said. “This is my job. This is my life. Without that, I feel lost.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m not the kind of girl that sits in the corner and cries about things,” she added. “I don’t consider myself a feminist, but boy, I will not lay down and play dead — ever.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A spokesperson for The Blaze did not immediately respond to <i>Motto</i>‘s request for comment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lahren also clarified her stance on <a href=#>abortion</a>. She said that she would never personally get the procedure, but said that she believes women should have the choice in the first trimester of pregnancy. “I believe you can be anti-abortion and pro-choice, and that’s where I sit,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a>. “We need to approach these issues with the upmost compassion for young women that are going through an experience that — luckily — I’ve never had to go through.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Watch the full <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> at ABC.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtb2NtgHGCjq2mpqFdoa6pvsSnZKanppp6sLqMrZ%2BeZZKhrruxjKCjnqaeYq%2Bmr8pmmJubXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
