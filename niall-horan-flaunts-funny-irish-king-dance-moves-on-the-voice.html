Wearing his all-white outfit, the “Slow Hands” singer went to tap dance as other coaches and audience members joyfully watch.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwen Stefani</a> chimed in while he’s doing the moves, likening Horan to a leprechaun. In Irish folklore, leprechauns are fairies in the form of a tiny old men said to secure a wee bit of luck in addition to three wishes. As Horan continues to dance, he later revealed he’s oblivious of the footwork he’s doing.</p><p>“I haven’t got a clue what I’m doing…in anything in life,” he said.</p><p>Soon after The Voice uploaded the hilarious scene on Instagram, the video has immediately got fans talking. Several fans went to the comment section to express how cute the coach is.</p><p>“King of Ireland I know that’s right,” one fan wrote.</p><p>“Dancing through life while you haven’t got a clue what you’re doing is the best way to do it,” another fan commented.</p><p>Horan was obviously happy to know that 13-year-old room will be on his team. The Warwick native sang “Dream a Little Dream of Me” by Ozzie Nelson and His Orchestra. With her distinct tone, Loome has reminded Horan of the previous winner of the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gina Miles</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-been-brewing-hilarious-rivalry-with-john-legend>He’s Been Brewing Hilarious Rivalry with John Legend</h2><p>As The Voice season 24 continues the heat of its game, it seems like Horan has founded a healthy rivalry against John Legend. After Chechi Sarai’s Blind Audition, the two managed to take a playful dig at each other to convince her to be part of their respective teams. After Horan used his persuasive vocal strat to Chechi, Legend humorously commented on it.</p><p>“You’re rambling, it feels like you’re just going around in circles,” Legend told Horan.</p><p>Then, when it was Legend’s turn to speak, Horan took the time to distract the coach.</p><p>“Boooo-ring!” he said.</p><p>Unfortunately though, despite their efforts to sway Chechi, the 32-year-old contestant chose no one between the two. She ended up choosing Stefani as her coach instead.</p><p>Meanwhile, during the October 2 episode of The Voice, both coaches <a href=#>blocked each other</a> at different times. Legend blocked the former One Direction member during Stee’s blind audition. Horan later blocked Legend during Rudi‘s performance. Amid this heated yet healthy competition, the “All of Me” singer knows Horan is not one to underestimate.</p><p>“Niall and I, we have a budding rivalry,” he said. “This young whippersnapper comes to ‘The Voice.’ He wins his first season. He thinks he’s the king over here. But I’m the O.G. This is my eighth season. And I’m not letting him take the throne.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_KatharineMcPhee_Taylor-Hill_Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Katharine McPhee Accidentally Bakes Son’s iPad in Her Oven" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKYpaRdnbyzrc1mnaWZpaPBtHnFrqWnsV2ev6q%2Fx2aioqaXYrGiusKeZKanpprAbrvNZquhnV2rvKqvxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
