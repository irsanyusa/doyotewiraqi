Bright Side put together a list of 6 of our favorite Hollywood actors who could’ve been married to their co-stars in real life.

There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good likelihood that these actors are friends in&nbsp;real life, as&nbsp;they express strong emotions and convince&nbsp;us that they love their on-screen partner with all their hearts.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> put together a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;6&nbsp;of&nbsp;our favorite Hollywood actors who could’ve been married to&nbsp;their co-stars in&nbsp;real life.</p><p><h2>1. Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder in&nbsp;<i>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9dc/aef/e548f651a1ade0300c92b0eecf.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Keanu Reeves says</a> he&nbsp;has been married to&nbsp;co-star <a href=# title="Winona Ryder" data-link=tag>Winona Ryder</a> for the past 29&nbsp;years because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene in&nbsp;the 1992&nbsp;movie, <i>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</i>. “We&nbsp;did an&nbsp;entire scene of&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding with real priests. Winona says we&nbsp;are. The director says we&nbsp;are. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;guess everyone thinks we’re married now,” Reeves said.</p><p>This was just a&nbsp;confirmation from Reeves, since Ryder was the one who first told the world about the accidental marriage. “No, I&nbsp;swear&nbsp;I think we’re married,” Ryder said. “The director used a&nbsp;real Romanian priest in&nbsp;that scene. So, I&nbsp;guess we’re engaged.”</p><p><h2>2. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in&nbsp;<i>Twilight Breaking Dawn</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a82/1a7/99e7f55582a07f3eec5a2331b5.jpg><p><a href=# title="Kristen Stewart" data-link=tag>Kristen Stewart</a> understood the significance of&nbsp;the wedding scene, since she had read the <i>Twilight</i> books. Therefore, the actress put significant pressure on&nbsp;herself to&nbsp;do&nbsp;well. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview</a> that her anxiety stemmed from real emotion when it&nbsp;came time to&nbsp;film the sequence.</p><p>“I&nbsp;was nervous for the wedding scene,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>she stated</a>. She sobbed when she saw the stage with the seats and the lights, and when she noticed that everyone was dressed differently. She said, “I&nbsp;could not leave that thing for a&nbsp;whole week. But it&nbsp;seemed like a&nbsp;formal event. The wedding appeared genuine.”</p><p><h2>3. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in&nbsp;<i>The Wedding Singer</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d6f/16e/9728365d088cbd31a077449ab3.jpg><p><a href=# title="Adam Sandler" data-link=tag>Adam Sandler</a> and <a href=# title="Drew Barrymore" data-link=tag>Drew Barrymore</a> have so&nbsp;many romantic movies (<i>The Wedding Singer,</i> <i>Blended</i>, and <i>50&nbsp;First Dates</i>) under their belt together, along with a&nbsp;few on-screen weddings you could easily believe were real. Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;doesn’t help that Sandler has expressed he’s always eager to&nbsp;work with Barrymore again whenever she’s up&nbsp;to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Sandler also really admires Barrymore. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>He&nbsp;said</a> that she’s cool and solid as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock, which is&nbsp;really how she&nbsp;is. “She just knows how to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that makes you think, ’Hmm, maybe we&nbsp;should talk about this.’ I&nbsp;always tell Drew everything when we&nbsp;talk.”</p><p><h2>4. Dane Cook and Kate Hudson in&nbsp;<i>My&nbsp;Best Friend’s Girl</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d14/d3f/815abf509e904402cd4d5c11e1.jpg><p>The leading roles in&nbsp;the 2008 romantic comedy, <i>My&nbsp;Best Friend’s Girl</i>, are played by&nbsp;Dane Cook, Jason Biggs, and <a href=# title="Kate Hudson" data-link=tag>Kate Hudson</a>. The movie’s wedding sequence is&nbsp;a&nbsp;crash course on&nbsp;what every bride and groom dreads will go&nbsp;wrong on&nbsp;their wedding day. An&nbsp;interviewer asked Hudson how she felt while shooting the wedding scene, and she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replied</a>, “I’m sure that anyone who doesn’t cry during that scene has no&nbsp;heart.”</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, Cook stated, “You know when you meet someone, and you’re already trying to&nbsp;make plans with them?” From this point, he&nbsp;knew immediately that they would get along well.</p><p><h2>5. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Keira Knightley in&nbsp;<i>Love Actually</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/99f/363/05509e5435930bca447334b6c0.png><p>Some actors give performances that remain with you. For Chiwetel Ejiofor, that was his portrayal as&nbsp;Peter alongside <a href=# title="Keira Knightley" data-link=tag>Keira Knightley</a> in&nbsp;<i>Love Actually.</i> “It’s Christmas to&nbsp;Valentine’s Day; everybody’s talking about the movie yearly, which is&nbsp;great,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ejiofor remarked</a>. Despite the complex plot, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ejiofor describes</a> the film as&nbsp;“so&nbsp;completely romantic and optimistic.”</p><p>He&nbsp;believes people do&nbsp;look for that kind of&nbsp;love. “They searched for it&nbsp;when the film was out. They seek it&nbsp;today, perhaps much more&nbsp;so. People want to&nbsp;connect with things that are upbeat, humorous, and full of&nbsp;optimism.” Moreover, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Knightley also believed</a> it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;love letter read worldwide.</p><p><h2>6. Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner in&nbsp;<i>13&nbsp;Going on&nbsp;30</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a83/532/60590e5d219834a9a23bf02a73.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jennifer Garner" data-link=tag>Jennifer Garner</a> once asked Mark Ruffalo, “Can you believe it’s been 18&nbsp;years since <i>13&nbsp;Going on&nbsp;30</i>?” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ruffalo then told Garner</a>, “It’s kind of&nbsp;like we&nbsp;got back together, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;can be&nbsp;parents in&nbsp;<i>The Adam Project</i>,” referring to&nbsp;their upcoming movie where Walker Scobell plays their on-screen child. “It&nbsp;was wonderful,” remarked Garner.</p><p>“We&nbsp;didn’t realize how much we&nbsp;needed or&nbsp;how amazing it&nbsp;felt to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together again. Making this film was a&nbsp;special experience, and its continued significance is&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift.” After all these years, the actress couldn’t be&nbsp;happier to&nbsp;have Ruffalo in&nbsp;her life. She said, “We’ve been woven into each other’s lives without really being together. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;felt like we&nbsp;picked up&nbsp;right where we&nbsp;left off.”</p><p><h2>Bonus: <i>Father of&nbsp;the Bride</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7b8/3e4/eb8caf5fed8142cd10f89940f2.png><p>In&nbsp;the remake of&nbsp;the movie from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1950</a>, which debuted in&nbsp;theaters in&nbsp;1991, in&nbsp;the final wedding scene, Steve Martin puts all jokes aside to&nbsp;reflect on&nbsp;what it’s like for a&nbsp;parent to&nbsp;watch their child get married. “I&nbsp;realized then that&nbsp;I would never come home again and see my&nbsp;little girl at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the stairs. Never see her at&nbsp;our breakfast table in&nbsp;her nightgown and socks.”</p><p>Martin says it&nbsp;as&nbsp;his daughter recites her vows at&nbsp;the altar. But then, it&nbsp;hit him all at&nbsp;once&nbsp;— she was leaving them now that she was all grown&nbsp;up. And something started to&nbsp;hurt inside.</p><p>Which relationship did you find the most surprising?
