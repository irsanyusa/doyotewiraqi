It is based on a live show by Gadd in which he recounts the true story of his attempts to transition from barman to comedian — including how he ended up being stalked for six months by a customer and was sexually assaulted by a man in the entertainment industry he had hoped would mentor him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Gadd claimed he had changed enough details about his stalker, named Martha in the show and played by Jessica Gunning, to ensure she wouldn’t be recognized but fans quickly began combing through the internet and identified a woman named Fiona Harvey as a possible candidate.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the series Martha is portrayed as a Scottish fantasist who claims to be a high-powered lawyer with impressive political contacts but in real life was a pitiful figure with a conviction for stalking. Over the course of six months she sends Gadd’s character Donny thousands of emails as well as targeting his parents and assaulting his girlfriend.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Harvey, who is Scottish and studied law, was once reportedly given a police warning for stalking.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Harvey told Morgan during the interview: “Even if the email thing was true, the rest is not” adding that she had never smashed up a bar or been convicted for stalking, as Martha is in the show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She said she first realized she was at the center of Gadd’s work when she saw an advert for his Edinburgh Festival show (on which “Baby Reindeer” is based) in which he was holding up a newspaper article about a previous stalking incident in which Harvey was reportedly evolved and she saw the name of the show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Morgan pointed out that given Harvey had been identified almost immediately after the show dropped on Netflix, both the streamer and Gadd’s duty of care towards Harvey had been “a spectacular failure.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Netflix declined to comment. Reps for Clerkenwell and Gadd did not respond to Variety by press time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpWPDor7InquyZpOkunB%2Bj2traKymZLStu8Gao2iakZfGbr7EoqWdnZWnerOxwKVkppmiqbWiecOepaKdo2LAta3LpKCnn12ltqa%2B0makqKqXlrtufZJxbm5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
