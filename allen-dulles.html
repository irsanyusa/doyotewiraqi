He was at the helm of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during pivotal moments of the Cold War, orchestrating key covert operations.</p><p>His leadership ended following the ill-fated Bay of Pigs Invasion, though later he served on the Warren Commission investigating President <a href=#>John F. Kennedy</a>'s assassination. His brother, <a href=#>John Foster Dulles</a>, served concurrently as the Secretary of State.</p><p>Born in 1893, Dulles graduated from Princeton University before joining the diplomatic service in 1916. He married Martha "Clover" Todd in 1920, and they went on to have three children. Dulles played a notable role in discrediting "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" in 1921.</p><p>He then served his country overseas in cities including Vienna and Bern, and participated in the Paris Peace Conference. Later, he pursued a law degree from <a href=#>George Washington</a> University Law School and became a partner at the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, in addition to directing the Council on Foreign Relations.</p><p>With the onset of World War II, Dulles's focus shifted to intelligence work with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Stationed in Switzerland, he was instrumental in intelligence collection and liaising with resistance entities. He contributed to Operation Sunrise, which laid the groundwork for the Nazi surrender in Italy.</p><p>After the war, he continued his duties in Berlin and Bern. During the 1948 Presidential election, he provided counsel to <a href=#>Thomas E. Dewey</a>, and he co-authored a pivotal report resulting in CIA reformation.</p><p>Dulles's career in intelligence peaked when he rose to Deputy Director of Plans at the CIA, later becoming Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. Under President <a href=#>Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, he was promoted to the role of Director.</p><p>His term at the CIA was marked by significant events, including orchestrating the coups in Iran in 1953 and Guatemala in 1954, as well as the creation of the U-2 spy plane program. The Bay of Pigs Invasion was a major disaster, however, and led to his removal by President Kennedy.</p><p>Subsequently, Dulles remained in the public eye after President <a href=#>Lyndon B. Johnson</a> named him to the Warren Commission. Despite being a controversial presence due to his CIA involvement, Dulles participated in the inquiry into Kennedy's assassination.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>April 7</a>, <a href=#>1893</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Watertown, New York, USA</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Lost Generation</b></a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Aries</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>January 30</a>, <a href=#>1969</a> (aged 75)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Influenza</a> complicated by <a href=#>pneumonia</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1953-02-09</a> General Walter Bedell Smith ends term as 4th Director of Central Intelligence Agency; Allen Dulles becomes Acting Director</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1953-02-26</a> Allen Dulles officially promoted from deputy director to become the 5th Director of the Central Intelligence Agency</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1961-11-29</a> Following the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion CIA Director Allen Dulles resigns and is replaced by John McCone</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Spies</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwrculnKdllKq5rbHS</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
