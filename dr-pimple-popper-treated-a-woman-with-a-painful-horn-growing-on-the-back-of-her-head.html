They're shaped (as you might expect) a lot like animal horns. These "horns" can grow outward from a variety of different skin issues, from benign moles and warts to malignant problems like skin cancer. One older study looking at 643 cases of cutaneous horns found that <a href=# id=2f18af1f-3f16-3258-a2f9-ae2005cf0696>just over 60% were caused by something benign</a> .</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-888a25d5-0e15-4b1d-8b80-f9465fe9a0cc data-caption="Dr pimple popper tlc_horn cyst_cutaneous horn"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/gVCktktTURBXy9kNTI1ZThhZC0xOWI4LTQ2NDYtOTY2ZC0wMGYwNzFlMTE3YmEucG5nkZUCzQMWzQG1wsM></span><p>In the episode, Lee said she has seen cutaneous horns before.

[it] sounds like it could be a pilar cyst and it has grown out of control," Lee told Lisa in the episode. "This is the angriest pilar cyst I've ever seen if thats the case. Usually, when we see a cutaneous horn, we do think of other things that might be a little bit more concerning. [It] can happen with types of skin cancers."</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-26>She removed it in one piece and testing revealed it was benign</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-2728061e-fbde-4367-9595-1d53231bb10e data-caption="Dr pimple popper tlc_horn cyst_procedure 2"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/CkQktktTURBXy9iMjVhMzVjNC0wYjQ0LTQ5NTktYTUzNi1jODllMWNkNmRkZDMucG5nkZUCzQMWzQGqwsM></span><p>In a quick procedure, Lee numbed the area around Lisa's growth and slowly pulled it off in one piece. After removing some skin to send to a lab for testing, Lee stitched up the area. She even grabbed a metal tray and knocked the horn against to demonstrate how hardened it was.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8748c394-68b0-40c7-9e9d-c6df7bd4a622 data-caption="Dr pimple popper tlc_horn cyst_post procedure 5"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/6DVktktTURBXy81NmVlMGRkMy00OGZmLTRjMDEtOTRiYy1hOWE3NThmMzI0M2MucG5nkZUCzQMWzQHrwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Later, Lisa returned to Lee's office for a follow-up appointment and for test results.</p><p>Luckily, the news was good: The horn had arisen from a cyst, not from skin cancer.</p><p>"The dermatopathologist read your slide and they say it's an inflamed follicular cyst," Lee told Lisa. "There's no risk of cancer. I dont think it's ever coming back."</p><p>When I get home and I see my daughter, I'm going to tell her that she has to put up with me for many more years to come," Lisa said that the close o the episode.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>&amp;lt;iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTLC%2Fvideos%2F350193365569342%2F&show_text=0&width=560" width="560" height="315" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allowFullScreen="true"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8OrZKmhnaW5pnnPqKepnaJiwbOxwK2cnWWRYsSwucCnZLChpJ16onnPmqCnnqWheqm70adkoKqfrLavs4yopWasmJp6o63CpGSonl2dsrN5x56YnWemaMZ1ttah</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
