We’ve already seen a superstar reveal when Demi Lovato was unmasked as the Anonymouse! And contestants like the Cow, decked out in 1950’s attire, will look to keep that momentum going.</strong></p><p>So who is the Cow? Let’s go through all the clues we have so far, the most popular guesses, and our prediction for which celebrity is under the mask.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfsGebH2Xh8</p>The Cow performs “Bones” by Imagine Dragons on The Masked Singer Season 10 Premiere</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 10</h2><p>The Cow’s clues started with them in the kitchen, dressed in 1950’s housewife/waitress attire. We saw a bag of “Two Step Coffee” while they talked about how they started writing because they used to have trouble handling their emotions. The clues show a day calendar flipped to “July 4th.”</p><p>He claims that his success “led him to #1,” and that he’s “won several Grammys,” “traveled the world,” and “made hit after hit.” Another clue is a Las Vegas sign on the fridge. At the end of his package, we see a set of pilot wings on top of a cake.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 10 PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><p>Once his performance was over, we got another clue in a popcorn bucket. It was a ticket that said “Blockbuster movie” on it. The Cow explained, “One of the better known things about me all started with a movie.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Cow</h2><p>The judges predicted that the Cow could be Shawn Stockman from Boyz II Men, Usher, or Hamilton star Leslie Odom Jr. Fans online think it could be BIlly Porter, RuPaul, Ne-Yo, or Leon Thomas III. Some also agreed that Usher was a good guess and it might be him!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Cow on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>After digging through all the clues and hearing that unmistakable clues, in the words on Ken, we know “EXACTLY who this is.” And the Cow is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ne-yo>Ne-Yo!</h3><p>And here are how all the clues connect to him.</p><p>We saw “Two Step Coffee” which is a nod to Ne-Yo being a dancer. He also mentioned dancing when the men in black presented a “Blockbuster Movie” ticket and explained that one of the better known things about him all started with a movie. That’s true because he was in Save the Last Dance 2 and Stomp the Yard early in his career.</p><p>The Cow talked about being a writer and Ne-Yo has written for many greats, from Rihanna and Beyonce to Celine Dion and Carrie Underwood. He’s been #1 multiple times, won several Grammys (3 total), traveled the world, and made hit after hit, as he claimed in the clues. The 4th of July calendar could be in reference to him performing at the White House on the 4th or one of his most popular songs, “Miss Independent.” The Las Vegas sign is a reference to the fact that he grew up in Vegas. Finally, the pilot wings on the cake were alluding to his role as a pilot in the movie Red Tails.</p><p>We’ll get more clues about the Cow in next Wednesday’s episode of The Masked Singer season 10!
