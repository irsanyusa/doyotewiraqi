They had more desire for 'solo-sex' and sex with a partner.</p><p>"This pattern suggests that those who view more visual sexual stimuli (VSS) are likely to have a higher sexual drive," researchers <strong>Nicole Prause</strong> and <strong>James Pfaus</strong> wrote in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Sexual arousal responsivity may not be impaired by viewing more VSS at home, as it actually was related to stronger desire and sexual arousal in two of the three relationships tested."</p><p>The study also looked at instances of erectile dysfunction. They found that "erectile functioning with a partner was not related to the hours of VSS viewed weekly".</p><p>While the results of the study point to a definite link between porn consumption and sexual desire, they should not be taken as definitive.</p><p>The men who were asked were all in their 20s, so the results do not offer insight to a broad range of ages.</p><p>It's also arguable that men who watch pornography do so due to a higher sex drive than those who don't, so it is natural that they should have more desire for real life encounters.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Sex is beneficial to our health so, that means porn is beneficial to our health?</p><p>What do you guys think about this new claim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2BmrdStsGaglZa5tbSOoZyapKSderW1z6xksKCpYr2wvs1mpKKfmKl6oq%2FTrpilpKlir6Z5xqimnWWWpL9uxc6uZnKkqmiBp7w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
