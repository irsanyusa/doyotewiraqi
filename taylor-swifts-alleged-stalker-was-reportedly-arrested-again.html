He was apparently seen at Swift’s New York residence around 30 times in the past few months.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-alleged-stalker-arrested-again>Taylor Swift’s Alleged Stalker Arrested Again</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FOX News</a>, the NYPD arrested an alleged stalker of Taylor Swift not long after he appeared in court on Wednesday on charges of stalking and harassment over his previous arrest on Monday. The suspect is reportedly a 33-year-old male from Seattle.</p><p>“Officers responded to a 911 call for a disorderly male in the vicinity of Franklin Street and Hudson Street, which is in the First precinct,” the NYPD told the outlet. “On arrival, a male left the location and walked into the First Precinct, where he was subsequently taken into custody without further incident. He was charged with four counts of criminal contempt.”</p><p>As of Thursday morning, FOX News reported that the man was still in police custody, and a judge granted a full order of protection. The man was reportedly charged with stalking in the fourth degree, as well as harassment in the first and second degree. He had been given supervised release.</p><p>The singer’s alleged stalker has apparently been “asked to leave [Swift’s home] over 10 times,”&nbsp;according to an assistant district attorney for Manhattan. He was reportedly seen there “approximately 30 times”&nbsp;between November 25 and January 22.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LINDSEY STIRLING HIRES PI TO CAPTURE ALLEGED STALKER LINKED TO TAYLOR SWIFT</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-stalker-was-reportedly-caught-dumpster-diving>The Stalker Was Reportedly Caught Dumpster Diving</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">New York Post</a>, the man in question was arrested on Wednesday afternoon after being caught rummaging through a dumpster across the street from Swift’s residence in Tribeca. The outlet shared photos of the alleged incident.</p><p>“I just saw him digging through this dumpster, taking out some blankets and then he just went and sat down on the loading dock a few doors down [from Swift’s apartment],” a neighbor shared. “I just thought, ‘Oh my god, I can’t believe this guy is back! I just want to never see this person again. I hope he gets the help he needs but he needs to leave our little street alone.”</p><p>The man was reportedly also detained on Saturday night for lurking near Swift’s home, but he was apparently released without charges.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_HarryJowsey_RyleeArnold_TSNight_Disney_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="Harry Jowsey to Join ‘DWTS’ Tour as Romance Rumors with Rylee Arnold Continue" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>taylor swift</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtqmaZnKGyqLHDZqqtmZygsrN51pqqZqqVpbyzwMSdo7Jlkae%2Fpr%2FTnptmmZeWtq97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
