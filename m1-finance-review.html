You can also manage your spending with its Owner’s Reward Card, save in a high-yield cash accounts account, and borrow through M1’s Margin and Personal Loan products.</p><p>While <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> offers a fully-automated investing experience. M1 automates your investments, but they leave the decision-making to you.</p><p>When you set up an <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> portfolio, you’ll be directed to create “pies”—groups of investments created for specific goals, such as retirement or socially responsible investing. Each pie has “slices,” which can be individual investments, other pies, or groups of pies. There can be up to 100 slices per pie.</p><h2 id=who-is-m1-finance-best-for>Who is M1 finance best for?</h2><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> is best for medium- to <a rel=alternate href=#>long-term investors</a> who want to choose their own investments while benefiting from its fully automated platform. M1 is not ideally designed for day traders or anyone looking for financial planning or advisor services.</p><h2 id=pros-and-cons>Pros and cons</h2><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Mobile app is intuitive and easy to use</li><li>Uninvested cash is directed to a high-yield cash account</li><li>Dynamic rebalancing keeps your investments balanced</li><li>No trading or management fees for stocks and ETFs</li><li>More than 80 pre-selected portfolios available</li><li>Over 6,000 choices for stocks and ETFs</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Limited educational content</li><li>Can’t buy mutual funds</li><li>Features are relatively limited compared to full-service online brokerages</li><li>No financial planning services or human advisors</li><li>Customer service options are limited</li></ul><h2 id=benefits-of-investing-with-m1-finance>Benefits of investing with M1 Finance</h2><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> has several benefits to offer investors of all experience levels.</p><h3>Intuitive mobile app</h3><p>The <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> app is easy to use. It will help you set goals and choose your investments, whether you prefer to select your investments or choose a pre-selected portfolio. The app will also guide you through opening a <a rel=alternate href=#>high-yield cash account</a>, <a rel=alternate href=#>applying for a credit card</a>, or taking out a loan. You can also rebalance your investments with a single click from the app to ensure they match your goals.</p><h3>High interest rates on uninvested cash</h3><p>Any cash you add to your <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> account that isn’t invested will be redirected to a high-yield cash account that offers a 5.00% <a rel=alternate href=#>annual percentage yield (APY)</a>. and $3.75M FDIC insurance. This allows you to earn a return on all the money in your portfolio, even if you’re not actively investing it.</p><h3>Dynamic rebalancing</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a>’s rebalancing function uses an algorithm to maintain the percentages you set for your investments. By dynamic rebalancing with auto-invest on gradually rebalancing your portfolio over time as new deposits are automatically invested into underweight holdings. This allows your portfolio to balance back towards your targets without selling, avoiding potential tax implications from rebalancing trades.This helps to ensure that your portfolio maintains your desired asset allocation.</p><h3>No trading fees</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> is one of many <a rel=alternate href=#>investing apps</a> that does not charge trading fees, which can help you maximize your returns. Other commission-free brokers include <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Public</a>, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Stash</a>, and <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Plynk</a>. M1 does charge other types of fees, which are detailed later in this review.</p><h3>Wide range of stocks and ETFs</h3><p>When you build your portfolio with M1 Finance, you can choose from more than 6,000 <a rel=alternate href=#>stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>, allowing you to create a customized, diversified portfolio.</p><h3>Wide range of pre-selected portfolios</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> offers more than 80 portfolio types, called “Model Portfolios.” Portfolios”. A model portfolio is a pre-built, diversified basket of investments designed to align with a specific investment strategy or goal that can be used as a starting point for investors to customize and build their own personalized portfolio. Model portfolios are not assembled by a specific individual “expert”.</p><h2 id=what-can-be-improved-in-m1-finance>What can be improved in M1 Finance?</h2><p>There are a few areas where <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> falls short and could stand to improve.</p><h3>No educational resources</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> doesn’t offer many educational resources, so it may be a better fit for those already familiar with the process. You can always find these resources outside the app to help improve your investing knowledge, but it’s an extra step you have to take, which could be seen as a downside by some.</p><h3>No mutual funds</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> doesn’t offer <a rel=alternate href=#>mutual funds</a>. While ETFs are a favorable alternative for many, if you’re a dedicated mutual fund investor, then M1 Finance likely isn’t the right platform for you.</p><h3>No access to live advisors</h3><p>As mentioned, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> is not a robo-advisor, but it also doesn’t offer live assistance for those who need extra help. It only offers self-directed brokerage services. This may not be a concern if you’re fairly comfortable with the investing process.</p><p>If you’re a <a rel=alternate href=#>beginner investor</a>, you might prefer a platform with access to live advisors who can help you build your portfolio. Higher net worth investors looking for advisor access might want to consider <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Empower</a>, which offers advisor access to anyone who invests $100,000 or more.</p><h3 class=product-title>Empower Financial Advisor</h3><p>Fees</p><p>0.89% or less</p><p>Account minimum</p><p>$100,000</p><p>Assets under management</p><p>$1.3 trillion</p><h3>Limited customer service options</h3><p>With <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a>, there is no customer service number you can call for assistance. However, if you need help with your account, you can schedule a call with a representative or submit an online help request and get a response within one business day. If you have an immediate question, though, you may need to wait longer than you’d prefer for an answer.</p><h2 id=how-does-m1-finance-compare>How does M1 Finance compare?</h2><p>Overall assessment of how the investing platform compares to the others in the table.</p><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK" readability=39><tr class=table-row readability=2><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Account minimum</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>$100 ($500 for retirement accounts)</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=16><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Accounts offered</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5><p>Self-directed brokerage, retirement, crypto</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5><p>Brokerage, retirement, crypto</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5><p>Brokerage, robo-advisor, retirement</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=5><p>Brokerage, robo-advisor, retirement</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=10><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Account & trading fees</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4.5><p>No trading fees; $100 outgoing transfer fee; $100 retirement account termination fee; $50 per month if the balance falls below $50</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>No trading or account fees; Robinhood Gold is $5/month</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4.5><p>No trading fees on stocks or ETFs priced $2.00 or higher, no account fees</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>No trading or account fees</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Customer service</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Phone or email</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Phone or chat</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Phone, chat, email</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>Phone, chat</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=m1-finance-in-depth-review>M1 Finance: In-depth review</h2><p>Let’s look deeper at what M1 offers and how it works.</p><h3>Usability</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> is easy to set up and use. Upon downloading the app, you’ll set up a username and password, enter your personal information, and be signed up for your account. From there, you can create financial goals, including investing money, maximizing earnings, and borrowing.</p><p>The app lets you easily see how your investments are doing and make changes to your portfolio as you see fit. You can also open a high-yield cash account and <a rel=alternate href=#>apply for a loan</a> or credit card, all through the M1 app.</p><h3>Investment options</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> shines with its wide range of stocks, ETFs, and customizable portfolio options. You can choose from more than 80 portfolios that fall into several categories, from general or responsible investing to planning for retirement. Alternatively, you can choose your investments and build your portfolio from scratch.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> offers more than 6,000 stocks and ETFs. However, compared to competitors, some might consider investment options limited.</p><h3>Costs</h3><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> doesn’t charge trading, commission, or portfolio management fees just a $3 monthly fee.</p><p>Besides the subscription fee, there are very few costs associated with using <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a>. There’s a $100 outgoing transfer fee and a $100 retirement account termination fee. Finally, while there are no monthly maintenance fees, you will be charged $50 per month if your balance falls below $50.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>There are no educational resources in the <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> app or website for novice investors who want to learn more about the process. However, if you’re a more experienced investor, you can take advantage of the research section. This section provides the latest investment news, lists information about the available stocks and funds, and lets you add securities to your watchlist. This can help you make more informed decisions about where to invest your money.</p><h3>Customer service</h3><p>The <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> Client Success Team can help you set up your account. Once you’ve created a login, you can schedule a 15-minute call with a team member to walk you through the process. The app uses Calendly to set up calls, so you can choose a time and date that works best for you. This prevents you from waiting on hold for an agent to answer the call.</p><p>The <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> website also has a Help Center that covers various topics, including getting started, accounts and settings, transfers, investing, borrowing, earning, and spending. If you can’t find the answer to your question in the Help Center, you can submit a request and receive a response within one business day.</p><p>However, there is no option to call customer service, so if you need to talk to someone immediately, you may be out of luck.</p><h3>Security and reliability</h3><p>The <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> app offers two-factor authentication for security and peace of mind. If you prefer to log in using biometrics, you can also set up Face ID.</p><h3>Company reputation</h3><p>The <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> app has a rating of 4.5 or above on the App Store and Google Play. It does have a low Trustpilot score of 2.2 stars (out of 5), from 156 total reviews.</p><h2 id=how-m1-finance-invests-your-money>How M1 Finance invests your money</h2><p>Unlike a robo-advisor, you choose how <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> invests your money based on your comfort level and experience. If you’re a new investor, you can opt for a pre-selected portfolio, which M1 calls its “Model Portfolios.” But if you are familiar with investing, you can select your investments to create a customized portfolio.</p><h3>Model Portfolios</h3><p>If you go with a pre-selected portfolio, you can choose your goal. <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> will invest your money and maintain the preferred mix of investments based on your risk tolerance.</p><p>These Model Portfolios fall into several different categories:</p><ul><li><strong>General investing</strong>: Create a portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance.</li><li><strong>Plan for retirement</strong>: Set a target retirement date, and your portfolio will adjust to your goals as you age.</li><li><strong>Responsible investing</strong>: Create a socially responsible portfolio for those who want to feel good about where they’re investing their money.</li><li><strong>Income earners</strong>: Create a portfolio to generate dividends and income.</li><li><strong>Just stocks & bonds</strong>: A portfolio of two ETFs focused on stocks and bonds.</li><li><strong>Other strategies</strong>: Includes all other portfolio options, including Cannabis Pie, Domestic Growth, Domestic Value, Global Growth, and Global Value.</li></ul><h3>Custom portfolios</h3><p>If you prefer to create a custom portfolio, you can choose from the more than 6,000 stocks and ETFs available to trade at <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a>. This is a good option for more experienced investors who prefer to pick their own investments. New investors will likely not choose this option, though they can work on their investment knowledge and eventually have the confidence and experience to craft a portfolio.</p><h2 id=how-does-m1-finance-make-money>How does M1 Finance make money?</h2><p>Since <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> doesn’t charge fees for portfolio management or trading, you may wonder how the platform makes money. There are several ways M1 Finance makes money.</p><ul><li><strong>Monthly fees</strong>: The $3 monthly fee and gives M1 Finance a consistent revenue stream.</li><li><strong>Interest</strong>: M1 Finance makes money via interest from its loan and credit card programs.</li><li><strong>Additional fees</strong>: M1 charges miscellaneous fees, such as $100 for IRA closures and outgoing transfers.</li></ul><h2 id=time-stamp-a-good-option-for-investors-with-some-prior-experience>TIME Stamp: A good option for investors with some prior experience</h2><p><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> is a unique app that combines self-directed investing with a fully automated platform. Its user-friendly platform makes it easy for investors to choose from individual investments and model portfolios.</p><p>Because <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> is a self-directed brokerage, it’s best suited for those with some prior investing experience. However, novice investors who are looking for a passive investing solution and who have a long-term mindset may be perfectly happy with how easy it is to invest with M1.</p><h3 class=product-title>M1 Finance</h3><p>Min. deposit</p><p>$100 for brokerage accounts and $500 for retirement accounts</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is M1 Finance a good choice for consolidating investments?</h3><p>Yes. <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>M1 Finance</a> allows you to consolidate investments by transferring external accounts into your M1 portfolio.
