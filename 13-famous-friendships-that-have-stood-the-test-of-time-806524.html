A&nbsp;true friend is&nbsp;there to&nbsp;support you, help you cope with difficult situations, and boost your happiness and self-worth. Everyone needs a&nbsp;good friend by&nbsp;their side, and it&nbsp;can seem hard to&nbsp;find one. Even celebrities, who are constantly surrounded by&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;people, need a&nbsp;special someone to&nbsp;support them through the ups and downs.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> love a&nbsp;persistent friendship, and we’d like to&nbsp;show you some examples of&nbsp;pure and true celebrity friendships.</p><p><h2>1. Cara Delevingne and Rihanna</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5dc/d56/5ecde45c599ecf1ca35e13aab3.jpg><p><a href=# title=Rihanna data-link=tag>Rihanna</a> and <a href=# title="Cara Delevingne" data-link=tag>Cara Delevingne</a> met at&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> show for the first time, when Cara playfully tapped her on&nbsp;the rear. Since then, they have been very playful and silly around each other. Even though they may come off as&nbsp;party-girl <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>besties</a>, their friendship goes way beyond that. It’s true that they are both busy and live far away from each other, but they can count on&nbsp;one another for tips and guidance no&nbsp;matter where they live.</p><p><h2>2. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/525/4c0/e2821e566d8b0cb835283ceba3.jpg><p>When Tina Fey and Amy Poehler met at&nbsp;Chicago’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ImprovOlympic</a>, they became inseparable and kept wanting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cast together. Although they’re quite different, they are like sisters and will always support one another. They’ve appeared on&nbsp;many covers and&nbsp;TV shows together, and are known as&nbsp;the “comedy team” by&nbsp;many.</p><p><h2>3. Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/902/4a7/b4c5fc5fc382eaebf1ed4304c1.jpg><p>These 2&nbsp;have been great <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>friends</a> for a&nbsp;very long time. Before they even met, Lily Tomlin was a&nbsp;big fan of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jane Fonda" data-link=tag>Jane Fonda</a>, saying that she even had the same hairstyle as&nbsp;her in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a>, <i>Klute</i>. In&nbsp;1977, they met at&nbsp;the Los Angeles theater and began their friendship journey by&nbsp;co-starring in&nbsp;the movie,<i> 9&nbsp;to&nbsp;5</i>. They even gave a&nbsp;TED Talk about how <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>important</a> it&nbsp;is&nbsp;for females to&nbsp;be&nbsp;great friends.</p><p><h2>4. Jennifer Lopez and Leah Remini</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c5/3ed/b780e15a3e8fe059de56357a6e.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a> and Leah Remini met through a&nbsp;mutual friend, Marc Anthony, while Jennifer was married to&nbsp;him. In&nbsp;2004, at&nbsp;Marc’s movie premiere, Leah noticed how gorgeous Jennifer’s skin was, and she also jokingly said that she was annoying but also very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>humorous</a>. She says that people can’t be&nbsp;smart and beautiful at&nbsp;the same time, but that didn’t count for Jennifer. They have been friends ever since, even after the divorce.</p><p><h2>5. Paul Newman and Robert Redford</h2></p><p>Paul Newman and Robert Redford have been good friends since <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1968</a> when they were cast together in&nbsp;the movie, <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>. But their friendship is&nbsp;stronger than just a&nbsp;casting-connection, they’ve been there for each other during marriages, illnesses, and the births of&nbsp;their children. Their friendship is&nbsp;so&nbsp;strong that they go&nbsp;so&nbsp;far as&nbsp;to&nbsp;call each other brothers.</p><p><h2>6. Robert De&nbsp;Niro and Martin Scorsese</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a9d/a2c/37c3835ce1bf41e0639c4f113d.jpg><p>Robert De&nbsp;Niro has been in&nbsp;many of&nbsp;Martin Scorsese’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movies</a>, but they’ve been friends for even longer. These 2&nbsp;met back in&nbsp;the day when they were teenagers, and their connection only grew as&nbsp;they made movies together. They can really trust each other and cannot imagine life without one another.</p><p><h2>7. Meghan Markle and Serena Williams<br></h2></p><p><a href=# title="Meghan Markle" data-link=tag>Meghan Markle</a> and <a href=# title="Serena Williams" data-link=tag>Serena Williams</a> first met at&nbsp;the SuperBowl in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2010</a>, but it&nbsp;wasn’t until 2014, when they played flag football together, that they became friends. They formed a&nbsp;bond instantly and took many pictures together. Meghan and Serena are both the same age and share common interests, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;love for hot sauce and fashion. But the thing that connected them the most was their limitless ambition in&nbsp;life.</p><p><h2>8. Oprah and Maria Shriver</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb1/196/ddcc375ca0a2e0d46ffe5b2a9a.jpg><p>Oprah Winfrey doesn’t have many friends, but she does have Maria Shriver, who’s been by&nbsp;her side for 42&nbsp;years. Surprisingly enough, they met in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bathroom</a> in&nbsp;between breaks, and their friendship is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;loyalty and consistency. Maria says it&nbsp;was the simple things, such as&nbsp;grabbing a&nbsp;cup of&nbsp;coffee, that made their friendship stronger.</p><p><h2>9. Sofía Vergara and Reese Witherspoon</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/777/506/07217a5495b8b2496f3990a267.jpg><p>Sofia Vergara and <a href=# title="Reese Witherspoon" data-link=tag>Reese Witherspoon</a> first met at&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hotel</a>, when Sofia came in&nbsp;and had everyone in&nbsp;the room stargazed. But they couldn’t really understand each other at&nbsp;first&nbsp;— Reese talked in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fast, Texas accent, while Sofia had a&nbsp;strong Colombian accent. As&nbsp;their friendship grew stronger, they became <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>travel</a> buddies and proud work-wives, and they never miss out on&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;good laugh in&nbsp;when together.</p><p><h2>10. Chrissy Teigen and Kim Kardashian West</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/dc6/181/c86329585894fcd71f280c13a5.jpeg><p>At&nbsp;first, Chrissy Teigen admitted to&nbsp;being nervous to&nbsp;meet Kim Kardashian, but when she zipped her up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the bathroom, she noticed that Kim was wearing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Spanx</a>. Kim agrees that Spanx united their friendship.</p><p>Not only are they just friends, but they’re also each other’s guides and inspiration. Kim was Chrissy’s maternity style advisor, while Kim was influenced by&nbsp;Chrissy’s post-baby body. They were also in&nbsp;Fergie’s music video together.</p><p><h2>11. Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b94/350/7f254255f2b6611611b56151dd.jpg><p>Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid had a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;common growing&nbsp;up. They went from showing up&nbsp;on&nbsp;reality&nbsp;TV shows from time to&nbsp;time to&nbsp;becoming <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>supermodel</a> best friends. Throughout their careers, they bonded and became such good friends that they wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>related</a>&nbsp;— even though they are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way through a&nbsp;wide string of&nbsp;marriages.</p><p><h2>12. Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d4/fd1/32dca95c89a0259ee629392c70.jpg><p>This friendship was based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;text at&nbsp;first sight. Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone’s first year of&nbsp;friendship was just <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>texting</a> each other often, and later developed into supporting each other career-wise and in&nbsp;their personal lives. The way they communicate is&nbsp;mostly through screaming at&nbsp;each other, and they would rather spend time alone than have anyone witness that. They claim that they are family and show endless support for one another.</p><p><h2>13. Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f8/d1c/6a81905b388478c112984113ad.jpg><p>These lovely ladies have been sidekicks since the very beginning&nbsp;— they even dated The Jonas Brothers together. Since their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>friendship</a> began in&nbsp;2008, Selena Gomez would always count on&nbsp;Taylor Swift for love advice, and they even performed “Who Says” together on&nbsp;stage. Taylor claimed that when you go&nbsp;through different transitions in&nbsp;life, it’s very “precious and rare” to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;friend to&nbsp;stick with you through it&nbsp;all.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;long-lasting friendship with someone? How did they influence your life?</p><p>From selling clothes on&nbsp;the streets of&nbsp;Barbados to&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;nine-time Grammy winner, <a href=#>Rihanna</a>’s journey is&nbsp;a&nbsp;true rags-to-riches story. Born to&nbsp;a&nbsp;warehouse supervisor and an&nbsp;accountant, she had a&nbsp;less-than-lavish upbringing but rose to&nbsp;stardom through sheer determination. Her father, Ronald Fenty, recalls her entrepreneurial spirit as&nbsp;she helped him sell clothes and even packaged candies for profit. Despite a&nbsp;hiatus from music, Rihanna has shifted her focus to&nbsp;her successful beauty and fashion ventures, all while embracing motherhood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH50ecWapKito2Kzs7XEp5usoJmlwG7Ax5qrZqCRq7Juv9Oopp1lpJ2ybsDErKtmp5Ziwaq5xGZvaW5lZ4Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
