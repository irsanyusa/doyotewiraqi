The most secretive show on television is continuing the trend of not spoiling anything about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the new season</a>. Fans already have an idea of who they would want to see compete this time around, and if any of these celebs take the stage, it’s bound to be the best season ever.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-todrick-hall>1. Todrick Hall</h2><p><a href=#>RuPaul’s Drag Race c</a>horeographer Todrick Hall would shine on The Masked Singer. He first grew a following on YouTube with his music videos that took funny spins on old classics. His song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Attention”</a> blew up on TikTok last year. Hall was a popular guess online last season for The Mushroom who was revealed to be Aloe Blacc. He does have a song out now with judge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicole Scherzinger</a> and the look on her face would be priceless if he was unmasked on the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CQhYxv3gfIu/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-seth-macfarlane>2. Seth MacFarlane</h2><p>Does anyone remember the internet rumor last season that Seth MacFarlane was The Frog? MacFarlane is a master at throwing his voice to portray several characters on Family Guy. MacFarlane has referenced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenny McCarthy</a> on on the show several times so it would be interesting to see how she would react to his unmasking. He actually is a pretty good singer and could pull off one of the most unexpected reveals of all time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CFQLX6vBep6/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-vanessa-hudgens>3. Vanessa Hudgens</h2><p>High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens is a multi-talented actress and singer. Hudgens has starred in two of Fox’s live musical productions: Grease: Live&nbsp;and Rent: Live. She has proved time and time again that she is an excellent live performer. Would the judges be able to recognize her voice right away?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CP9Qyb1Bda-/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-corbin-bleu>4. Corbin Bleu</h2><p>Keeping with the theme of High School Musical, another celebrity fans want to see on The Masked Singer is Corbin Bleu. Fans on Reddit have already started to guess that Bleu is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dalmatian</a> this season. He was named the runner-up on Season 17 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing with the Stars</a> so he knows how to command attention from viewers. Bleu is a dynamic Broadway performer with an energy that would light up the stage, even under a crazy costume.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CR5YGJjoCgt/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-rob-lowe>5. Rob Lowe</h2><p>Rob Lowe has been a heartthrob since his days as a member of the Brat Pack. He became a huge highlight of the NBC comedy Parks and Recreation. Lowe has been tapped to be the brand spokesperson for pretty much every new product on the market. His smile and magical powers that prevent him from aging have made him one of the most loved actors in Hollywood. He’s the perfect candidate for The Masked Singer Season 6.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CRcon5PF8yp/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-tom-brady>6. Tom Brady</h2><p>Fans are hoping to see seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady take the stage on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 6</a>. After the first character of the season was revealed to be a <a href=#>Dalmatian wearing football gear</a>, fans speculated that an NFL star would be behind the mask. When he’s not dominating the NFL in pretty much every major category, Brady has made several notable television and movie appearances. Each season of The Masked Singer boasts the singing talents of some of the world’s most famous athletes. Brady really is the best of the best.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CRwSS4jgy3J/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-emma-stone>7. Emma Stone</h2><p>Emma Stone is one of the most in-demand actresses in Hollywood. After starring in the film Cruella, fans are hoping to see Stone as The Dalmatian. The Academy Award winner proved just how talented she is, singing in the film La La Land alongside Ryan Gosling. Stone welcomed her first child in March, but we’ve learned not to rule anyone out when it comes to The Masked Singer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-jamie-foxx>8. Jamie Foxx</h2><p>Take a shot every time the judges mention Jamie Foxx’s name on The Masked Singer. Foxx is by far the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most guessed celebrity on the show.</a> He even served as a guest judge to prove that he was not underneath any of the masks. Season 6 could finally be time for him to put on a costume and compete so the judges can stop guessing his name.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CSVGzucBLPo/</p></figure><p>The Masked Singer always throws some major curveballs in the mix when it comes to casting. The show almost always features someone controversial who is looking for redemption. In the past, we saw Jordyn Woods show that she is way more than just Kylie Jenner’s former bestie.</p><p>Celebrities who have competed on Dancing with the Stars in the past usually also make the jump to The Masked Singer like Kelly Osbourne and Laila Ali. Expect at least one celebrity to make the leap from the ballroom to The Masked Singer stage. We’ll just have to wait and see who is unmasked during the show’s two-night premiere.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thumbnail_PhotoByJordanFuller_Instagram.jpg alt="Sian Fuller Sparks Sibling Rivalry on ‘The Voice Australia’ After Spontaneous Audition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZpyfYsawwYywmKesXam8br%2FEnmScp52lsrWxjKilZquVlsCwuoxvZKieXam1pnnMmqqknZRiwKq6xp6paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
