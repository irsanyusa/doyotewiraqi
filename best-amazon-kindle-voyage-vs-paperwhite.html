There’s the new $199+Kindle Voyage, the $119+ Kindle Paperwhite and the $79+ standard Kindle to choose from. Here’s a closer look at what you’re getting.
ScreenSize
Choosing by screen size is easy since they’re all six inches diagonally. Things change once we dig into resolutions and lighting technology.
Resolution
The Kindle Voyage has the best screen, with a 300 pixels-per-inch resolution."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Here’s a closer look at what you’re getting.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Screen</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Size</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Choosing by screen size is easy since they’re all six inches diagonally. Things change once we dig into resolutions and lighting technology.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Resolution</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Kindle Voyage has the best screen, with a 300 pixels-per-inch resolution. The more pixels smooshed into an inch of screen, the better everything looks. The Kindle Paperwhite smooshes 212 pixels into an inch; the standard Kindle smooshes 167 pixels into an inch.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The big question is whether your eyes can discern the differences. I can tell you that when looking at the Paperwhite and the Voyage side by side, the difference is noticeable when looking at graphics and slightly less noticeable when looking at text. The standard Kindle looks… I wouldn’t say “the worst” because it doesn’t look bad. It just looks least good; let’s say that. I’d say the $40 jump from the standard Kindle to the Kindle Paperwhite is a much better value than the $80 jump from the Paperwhite to the Voyage, though.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Reading Light</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The standard Kindle has no light; the Paperwhite and Voyage both have built-in lights. They both max out at nearly the same brightness, although the Voyage looks a little cleaner and whiter, and can automatically adjust its screen brightness to match your environment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Touchscreen</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All three devices feature touchscreens, though the Kindle Voyage features squeeze-able side bezels that allow you to turn pages back and forth as well. There’s a nice little vibration feedback with each press when using the Voyage.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Video: Kindle Paperwhite vs Kindle Voyage</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s a closer look at the $119 Paperwhite up against the $199 Voyage, with some analysis of all three models at the end:</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Storage</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wondering which Kindle can hold the most books? The answer is yes. Yes to any of them: They all have four gigabytes of storage, good for over a thousand books.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Size</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Kindle Voyage is the smallest, measuring 6.4″ long by 4.5″ wide by 0.3″ thick and starting at 6.3 ounces (the 3G version weighs 6.6 ounces).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Kindle Paperwhite measures 6.7″ long by 4.5″ wide by 0.36″ thick and starts at 7.3 ounces (the 3G version weighs 7.6 ounces). The standard Kindle measures 6.7″ long by 4.7″ wide by 0.4″ thick and weighs 6.7 ounces (there’s no 3G version).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">They’re all incredibly portable. I’m not sure buying one over the other based on a tenth of an inch here or an ounce there makes a whole lot of sense, but those are the measurements.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Battery Life</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The standard Kindle lasts up to four weeks on a single charge, assuming a half hour of reading each day with the wireless connection turned off. It fully charges within four hours.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Kindle Voyage lasts up to six weeks on a single charge, assuming a half hour of reading each day with the wireless connection turned off and the light set at 10 (the max is 24). It fully charges within three hours.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Kindle Paperwhite lasts up to eight weeks on a single charge, assuming a half hour of reading each day with the wireless connection turned off and the light set at 10 (the max is 24). It fully charges within four hours.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So as we see here, the Paperwhite actually has the best battery life. That’s probably a factor of its screen not having to push as many pixels around as the Voyage’s screen. The Paperwhite being ever so slightly thicker than the Voyage might make for a slightly higher-capacity battery as well.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">3G or Not 3G?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That is the question. Adding a 3G cellular connection to your Kindle Paperwhite or Kindle Voyage adds $70 to the price tag, but results in being able to download books anywhere you have an AT&T signal — over 100 countries and territories are covered (see <a href=# rel=noopener>this map</a>). There are no monthly service charges for downloading books, though you might incur added charges for downloading magazines and other periodicals.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you read a lot of books and want to be able to download new ones frequently — especially while you’re on the move — the 3G version of whichever Kindle you’re considering is a no-brainer. If you’re going to be using the Kindle at home a lot or you’ll be around accessible Wi-Fi networks, save the $70.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Best Bet</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To be clear, the new Kindle Voyage is an amazing e-book reader. It’s super portable, its screen is gorgeous and the added haptic-feedback page turns are a nice touch. However, the $119 Kindle Paperwhite is still a dynamite e-book reader and is a very worthy upgrade for $40 over the standard Kindle because of its higher-resolution screen and its built-in light. Making the $80 jump from the $119 Paperwhite to the $199 Voyage is simply a much tougher sell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbWJpgnV9jpucrKxdlrqixs6nZKShnpm5pnnVqLCan5Viw7R5z5qnnqqnnba1sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
