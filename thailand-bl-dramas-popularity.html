With their blushing humility and matinee idol looks, they effortlessly charm the assembled office workers and students in uniform.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yet it is Jitaraphol’s hand on the small of Tawinan’s back, and their fleeting glances, that elicit the loudest cheers. The intimate gestures echo their exchanges in the new series <i>Vice Versa</i>—one of many queer romances that are Thailand’s hottest cultural export. Known locally as Y shows, and globally as Boys’ Love (BL) dramas, the serials are poised to compete with South Korean telenovelas for viewership in Asia and beyond.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some see BL as Thailand’s soft power, doing for the Southeast Asian nation’s global image what the yoga boom has done for India or K-pop for South Korea. Jitaraphol tells TIME that the country’s queer dramas “can compete with series from other countries.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Poowin Bunyavejchewin is a senior researcher at the Institute of East Asian Studies at Thammasat University in Bangkok, who has made a study of BL. He says that if the genre was able to hook foreign audiences “it would be a high potential revenue generator.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>How ‘Queer as Folk’ Became a Defining Gay TV Show</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">BL’s success isn’t a given, however. Thailand is a socially conservative, primarily Buddhist country with a significant Muslim minority. The country’s military-backed regime—known for its use of <a href=#>repressive laws</a> to <a href=#>crack down</a> on politically progressive forces—is also unlikely to be enthusiastic about the country’s burgeoning reputation as an exporter of luscious gay TV.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It isn’t just the growth of an entertainment genre at stake. Thomas Baudinette, a cultural anthropologist at Sydney’s Macquarie University, credits BL with an “emancipatory, very positively framed, romantic depiction of male-male love.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In that sense, a setback for BL is a setback for <a href=#>LGBT</a> representation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/SKY-IN-MY-HEART-thailand-boys-love-tv.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The development of Boys’ Love dramas</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">BL has its beginnings in 1970s Japan, when women created homoerotic <i>manga</i> called <i>yaoi</i> for other women. Some <i>yaoi </i>became commercially successful and were turned into animé. By the 1990s, publishing houses were producing <i>yaoi </i>for a mass market. With the advent of the internet, <i>yaoi</i> crossed borders.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first Thai BL dramas were made in 2014, but the genre didn’t start to take off until the COVID-19 pandemic kept many people at home, glued to their devices, browsing for new content to stream. BL’s escapist storylines and vaguely androgynous actors were an instant hit with audiences seeking to block out a depressing new reality of lockdowns, mask mandates, social distancing measures, and quarantine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">University rom-com <a href=# rel=noopener><i>2gether</i></a>, which first aired in 2020, was BL’s breakout show, amassing at least <a href=# rel=noopener>100 million views</a> on the now-defunct Thai streaming platform LINE TV. It found fans in socially conservative nations, like <a href=# rel=noopener>China</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Indonesia</a>, and as far afield as <a href=# rel=noopener>Latin America</a>. The success of <i>2gether</i> prompted producers in South Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam to try their hand at the genre.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Homophobia Is Not an Asian Value</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In June 2021, Thailand’s investment promotion arm helped secure <a href=# rel=noopener>360 million baht</a> ($10.7 million) in foreign investment for Thai BL. That may be a modest sum by the standards of Hollywood, but it represents BL’s new, export-oriented mindset. GMMTV, the production company that makes <i>Vice Versa</i>, has already made deals with <a href=# rel=noopener>Japan’s TV Asahi</a> and Philippine broadcaster <a href=# rel=noopener>ABS-CBN</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They have shifted from being a domestically focused company to one that recognises that their product has legs in a global market,” Baudinette says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CUPIDS-LAST-WISH-thailand-boys-love-tv.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Boys’ Love and social conservatism</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But outbreaks of “moral hysteria” will jeopardize BL’s chance to flourish globally, warns Poowin. When the Thai government boasted of its efforts to tout BL to overseas producers, it played down same-sex love and instead spoke coyly of BL’s “interesting and unique plots and talented actors.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the face of it, Thailand is LGBT friendly. It has taken steps to become the first country in the region to legalize same-sex unions and its tourism sector famously welcomes the pink dollar.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Advocates of same-sex marriage still have <a href=# rel=noopener>many hurdles to overcome</a>, however. When marriage equality activist <a href=#>Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree</a> kissed his boyfriend on the steps of parliament in December 2019, it sparked a huge homophobic backlash. Social tolerance of the LGBT community “has significant limits” according to a 2021 <a href=# rel=noopener>report</a> from Human Rights Watch.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Tell Queer Stories Instead of Focusing on Queer Characters</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While Poowin dismisses as “myths” the notion of Thailand as a pious Buddhist society, there can be no doubt about the country’s deep-rooted <a href=# rel=noopener>social and political conservatism</a>. <a href=# rel=noopener>Broadcast laws</a> forbid shows that undermine “good morals,” and Thai TV censors are notorious for blurring out anything from alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking to <a href=# rel=noopener>cleavages</a> and even <a href=# rel=noopener>single-use plastic bags</a>. Cuts appear to be made arbitrarily. <a href=# rel=noopener>Rape culture</a> and violence are a staple in Thai dramas—but <a href=# rel=noopener>scenes</a> of two women kissing were deleted from a show before it aired in February 2021.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to Poowin, being gay runs against the version of national identity upheld by the Thai government but BL’s potential as a revenue earner means that it is being tolerated—for now. “Given the social mores positively identified as part of Thainess, the government has monitored [BL] series, ensuring that they do not cross the red line,” he says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">BL producers are also careful not to push their luck. Critics of BL within the Thai queer community say the genre presents a soft-focus version of what it means to be gay and fails to reflect the <a href=#>systemic discrimination</a> faced by LGBT people in the kingdom.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Disney’s Public Reckoning Over LGBT Equality</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In response, the director of <i>Vice Versa</i>, Nuttapong “X” Mongkolsawas, says the show has touched on the topic of marriage inequality and is prepared to deal with other LGBT issues “if there is a way that we feel is appropriate, at the right time and right place in the series.” Other BL series have not shied away from discussing social issues like corruption, drugs, and political protest.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nuttapong believes that the genre has a real shot at changing the culture by going mainstream. Through BL, he says, socially conservative viewers “might discover that there really is more love like this in modern society, and that it is not abnormal, and nothing is wrong about it, and that it is not considered taboo anymore.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In other words, it is precisely through its commercial appeal that BL can increase LGBT visibility in places previously deprived of queer representation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Yes, it’s about money,” Baudinette tells TIME, “but that doesn’t necessarily always mean that it’s a bad thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamBthXKDjq2fmqGclrulecGlZJ2qkaKutHnPqKeupJGntrXFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
