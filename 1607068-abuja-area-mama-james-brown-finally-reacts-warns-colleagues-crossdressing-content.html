I have never dressed like a woman and stood on the road, never, it has never been my portion. My own drag queen na to shoot content for Instagram, na to shoot movie. Everybody represents different things. Have you ever heard me say I’m doing runs before? What is that? I have never done it. Even though you’re a drag queen, it doesn’t mean you should do your drag and stand on the road, waiting for somebody to carry you. Nigeria is a homophobic country, stay safe out there. People that are saying ‘James, you next’, you fit see me? Can you access me? When last did you even see me face to face?
