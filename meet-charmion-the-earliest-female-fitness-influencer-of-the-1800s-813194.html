This woman, who performed under the stage name, Charmion, was a&nbsp;real person and one of&nbsp;the earliest female fitness influencers&nbsp;— let’s find out about her story together.</p><h2>Strongwomen in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Victorian</a> era performed feats of&nbsp;strength and skill as&nbsp;entertainment.</h2><p>They lifted weights, engaged in&nbsp;wrestling matches with men, and performed acrobatics, challenging the societal norms of&nbsp;their time. These women were considered unusual, as&nbsp;they defied the notion that women were weak. These powerful individuals shattered the traditional mold and raised questions about the prevailing standards of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>femininity</a> and beauty, which emphasized the importance of&nbsp;delicate and fragile women whose primary role was childbearing.</p><p>These strong women smashed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>societal</a> norms, serving as&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiration to&nbsp;other women to&nbsp;prioritize exercise, healthy eating habits, and overall wellness. They were viewed as&nbsp;role models and trailblazers, challenging the status quo. Moreover, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;era where men were considered the sole providers for their families, these women earned their own income and forged successful careers by&nbsp;performing in&nbsp;shows around the globe.</p><p><h2>Charmion became famous for her daring and provocative persona.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e61/5c6/a4e999527fa7616ea984c06f5c.jpg><p>Born in&nbsp;1875, Laverie Vallee was famous under the stage name Charmion. She came across a&nbsp;newspaper advertisement about a&nbsp;theater looking for a&nbsp;young woman for an&nbsp;acrobatic act. She was accepted and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>trained</a> for 4&nbsp;months, during which she learned all the tricks on&nbsp;the trapeze and horizontal bar. She made her debut in&nbsp;an&nbsp;aerial show in&nbsp;New York on&nbsp;Christmas Day of&nbsp;1897. During the performance, Charmion disrobed from a&nbsp;full outfit down to&nbsp;tights and a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>leotard</a>.</p><p>Charmion would often lift heavy weights, bend iron bars, and wrestle with men. She was among the first women to&nbsp;showcase her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>muscular</a> physique in&nbsp;public and to&nbsp;promote physical fitness for women. In&nbsp;other words, she could easily be&nbsp;considered one of&nbsp;the first-ever female fitness influencers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3fc/653/e21a095c1eaa930bef803d7265.png><p>During a&nbsp;time when photography technology was still in&nbsp;its early stages, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Charmion</a> caught the attention of&nbsp;renowned inventor Thomas Edison. In&nbsp;the late 1800s, Edison was experimenting with motion picture technology, and he&nbsp;saw Charmion as&nbsp;the ideal subject for a&nbsp;film that was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;produced in&nbsp;1901.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f9/268/85944d59ea9106b31606155673.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Trapeze Disrobing Act</i></a> was a&nbsp;brief, 3-minute silent film produced by&nbsp;Edison and sold for a&nbsp;few cents at&nbsp;the time. The film showcased Charmion on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trapeze, removing her clothing to&nbsp;the pleasure of&nbsp;a&nbsp;few male spectators who were also part of&nbsp;the show. These men acted like teenagers, reveling in&nbsp;the sight of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman undressing, which wouldn’t have the same effect on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>audiences</a> today.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/037/6fb/1db8c65ec69aa18e09716af3dd.jpg><p><h2>The female fitness icons we&nbsp;know today have walked in&nbsp;the footsteps of&nbsp;the pioneering strongwomen of&nbsp;previous centuries.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0fd/6de/6d8ad351d596ec324140884754.jpg><p>Jessica Buettner, professional powerlifter, crowned as&nbsp;the Powerlifting World Champ in&nbsp;2022</p><p>As&nbsp;we&nbsp;speak, the female fitness industry is&nbsp;evolving and diversifying, offering a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;options and opportunities for women to&nbsp;pursue their fitness goals and express themselves confidently. Similar to&nbsp;the traditional strongwomen, today’s female athletes have built communities where they lift each other&nbsp;up, and show each other that women can accomplish anything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/71b/53b/149a455f4dabbfe24fc343c54d.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the greatest <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>athletes</a> of&nbsp;our time, superwoman Dr. Stefi Cohen has 25&nbsp;all-time records in&nbsp;weightlifting under her belt.</p><p>Displaying their strength and skill on&nbsp;social media, in&nbsp;weightlifting and bodybuilding competitions, today’s female heroines lead the way and keep challenging the stereotypes that still persist in&nbsp;our society. A&nbsp;notable example of&nbsp;this is&nbsp;Angela Seung Ju&nbsp;Lee, who became the youngest person to&nbsp;ever win a&nbsp;world championship.
