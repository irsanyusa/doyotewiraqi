Despite this, in 1861 he was appointed to a midshipman position at the outbreak of the Civil War. He had two brothers, <a href=#>Alonzo Cushing</a> and <a href=#>Howard B. Cushing</a>, both of whom died in the war.</p><p>Meanwhile Cushing himself quickly gained a reputation for boldness, volunteering for hazardous assignments and proving himself in various naval operations. His most famous exploit, however, was the sinking of the Confederate ironclad.</p><p>In October 1864, Lieutenant Cushing led a small group of men in a steam launch equipped with a spar torpedo against the Albemarle, which was anchored on the Roanoke River in North Carolina. Despite heavy fire from Confederate forces, Cushing managed to get close enough to detonate the explosive, which blew a hole in the hull at the waterline "big enough to drive a wagon in." While Cushing himself escaped, most of his crew were captured and two drowned in the aftermath.</p><p>After the war, Cushing continued his service in the Navy, though his post-war career was affected by health issues arising from his service during the conflict. His health deteriorated, and he died at the age of 32.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>November 4</a>, <a href=#>1842</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Delafield, Wisconsin, USA<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Scorpio</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>December 17</a>, <a href=#>1874</a> (aged 32)<br></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Naval Career</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1864-10-27</a> Confederate ship CSS Albemarle torpedoed and sunk by a spar torpedo mounted on a steam launch commanded by William B.
