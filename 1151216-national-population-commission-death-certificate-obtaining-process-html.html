As you can see, apart from rendering quite a lot of information and documents, there’s nothing really complicated in the procedure. This is a short guide on how to register death and obtain an NPC certificate easily, quickly, and without additional fuss and problems.</p><h2>Are there cases when an NPC certificate cannot be obtained or other special cases?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/2dcc40a9dcea10c3.jpeg><p class=align-left>However as simple as the procedure seems to be, it’s necessary to remember that death certificates can’t be issues in a number of situations:</p><ul><li>If a person dies under suspicious circumstances</li><li>If a person is a subject of a police investigation</li><li>If the family is against autopsy</li></ul><p class=align-left>In all these cases, medical facilities have no right to issue any death certificates. Besides that, if the deceased person was a criminal and died under the governmental custody, the body can never be given to the family. In this situation, the death certificate will not be given out, either.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/ba471ea66eb848f3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>AMVERIFIED: Africa’s indigenous social network community</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Regarding the situations when all the demands are observed, blood relatives are not the only ones who can receive a death certificate but it happens in extremely rare cases. It can happen that a deceased person has no blood relatives living but a spouse only. Technically, spouses are not blood relatives, yet, they can receive certificates of their spouses’ death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7i0ohv36n6f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Sometimes, other family members can obtain death certificates on behalf of blood relatives because of financial conditions or literacy. In such a situation, it’s necessary to appoint somebody (he or she may not even be a family member) who would represent the family members in a due way. For instance, biological children of the blood relatives of the deceased person can be the representatives in such a situation.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Requirements for international e-passport in Nigeria</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnKBkGtob2WelsGqu82ao2aon6XCra3ToqanZZOkuq610qygqKZdmbKiwMdmmp6qpJ6zqq%2FArZxmp5Kprqq6yKeeZqiipLCmv9Jnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
