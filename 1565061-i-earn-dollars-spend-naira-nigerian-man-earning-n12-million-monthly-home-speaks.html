So I’d say my purchasing power remains roughly where it was. Except for imported stuff, my purchasing power does outstrip the inflation on the ground, but not by much. And I cannot save as much as I would like.”<p class=align-left>Mr. Seun said he buys things in bulk whenever he <a href=#>can</a> and avoids spending on unnecessary items. He also does not commute daily, as <a href=#>he works from home</a>, so he does not have to worry about the high cost of transportation.</p>“Bus fares are way higher than they were. Still, I don’t commute daily so I’d say not really a concern there. As for the budget. In dollar terms, everything, especially big ticket items, still cost roughly what they did,” he said.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f4280364d1e854e7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“People laugh at me for not having money”: Buhari finally explains why he approved new naira notes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Nigerian millionaire saves and invests in dollars wherever possible and avoids naira-based investments, such as land, which he thinks are not worthwhile at the moment.</p><p class=align-left>He told <strong>Legit.ng</strong>:</p>“I just save and invest in dollars wherever possible. I avoid Naira-based investments in things like land. Not really worthwhile at the moment since a 3x increase in, say, 5 years may be the same value as the money I invested in 2023.”<p class=align-left>Mr. Seun reiterated that it is easier to live in Nigeria when you earn in dollars, but he is not oblivious to the suffering he sees around him:</p>“Earning in dollars makes it easier to stomach on a personal level. But seeing the level of suffering out there is disconcerting and makes me dread what would happen if I ever go back to square one."<h2>Nigerian man earning 200k monthly cries out over high living cost</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/21103db20c45dcd4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“I would have moved to Niger Republic”: Buhari speaks on daily ‘harassment’ at Daura residence</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Meanwhile,<strong> Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported Nigeria's severe economic crisis, with inflation <a href=#>reaching its historic high</a> in 2023.</p><p class=align-left>The rising cost of living has eroded the purchasing power of many Nigerians, especially the young and salary earners.</p><p class=align-left>One of them is Sada Khalidu*, a 29-year-old man who works as a marketer at a private media company in <a href=#>Kano</a>, the second-largest city in the country.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvaa7z6WcaGlla4JxgpBmoGadkae7brDOpaOaqqNiwLGxzZ1kp5mZp65uusignKuhkaN6rq3NZpyaqp6eu6h5zWppZqWZobmqu81mpKimpJ25unnHqKSeZaOlsqK30mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
