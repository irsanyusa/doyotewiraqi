Those who believe it is will point out that it was the Yuletide chart-topper in 1994, that it is played frequently at Christmas time, that the tune features bells and that the music video features snow."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

About a third (34%) say Stay Another Day is a Christmas song, while 29% say it is not. However, a large proportion of people (37%) say they don’t know (which includes all of those who aren't familiar with the song).</p><p>Breaking the results down by age reveals that Brits between the ages of 25 and 54 are closely tied on the festive nature of the song. The key differences are among the oldest and the youngest Brits. Those aged 55+ split more strongly against Stay Another Day being a Christmas song, while 18-24 year olds split in the opposite direction.</p><p>However, both age groups had a higher rate of “don’t know” responses, implying a lack of familiarity with the tune, and it was this, rather than a specific boost to one side or another, that led to the disparity in the results.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Stay20another20day20stacked-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYW6GcYCMrKuasV2Wu7DAx56pZpyRrnqktNGiqq2lkah6tLvNoA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
