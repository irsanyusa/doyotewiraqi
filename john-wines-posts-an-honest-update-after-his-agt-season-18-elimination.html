Hailing from the UK, the 59-year-old guitar tutor and viral TikToker left a lasting impact on the show.</p><p>While his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> journey might have ended in the semi-finals, but his gratitude for the opportunity and the support he received throughout the competition shines through. In a recent Instagram update, Wines shared his reflections as he prepared to head back home after his memorable run on the show.</p><p>“Hi guys. So just a quick update. Uh, we’re just waiting to be picked up, ready to go to the airport to go home,” Wines said. “Am I disappointed I’m not going through? Yeah, a little bit. I wouldn’t be human if I wouldn’t.”</p><p>Although he was admittedly disappointed with the outcome, the talented guitarist showcased his resilience and appreciation for the journey. While his run on AGT might have ended, Wines’ <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">musical</a> journey continues as he sets his sights on forming a band and exploring new collaborations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-john-wines-addressed-the-simon-cowell-controversy>John Wines Addressed the Simon Cowell Controversy</h2><p>Wines’ journey was not without its share of controversy, largely centered around a critique from judge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>. During his performance, Wines wowed the audience and fellow judges, but Cowell’s comments didn’t sit well with fans.</p><p>Cowell’s remarks were perceived as rude and condescending, causing a backlash among viewers who disagreed with his assessment. Wines addressed the controversy in his Instagram update.</p><p>“Am I bothered about the Simon Cowell thing? Uh, no, not really. Um, just prerogatives this show.” Wines said. “I don’t know why he said what he did. I certainly don’t know why he said about my wife.”</p><p>He opened up referring to Cowell’s comments about his wife’s potential reaction to the performance. Wines also empathetically recognized the immense pressure of performing live, and what he could’ve done to make it better.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NUP_195979_02837-e1638554070188.jpg alt="All The Never-Heard-Before Secrets Ariana Grande Told in Her ‘Yours Truly’ Q&As" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaifp2Wnnrumv4yppqyso2Kur3nHqKWeq6RiwrGwwK2cZpmWqbKzeceiqmaZl6l6tLHArKanZWFteqa4yKagp5mknryvew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
