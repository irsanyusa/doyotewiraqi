No other show on American television provides a place to showcase this particular skill, so let’s take a look back at some of the best ventriloquists we’ve seen on the show over the years</strong>.</p><p>Unlike our <a href=# class=broken_link>magic list</a>, we’re only including five acts for this category instead of 10. While the ventriloquy category has the second-highest number of AGT winners of any talent (only behind singers, though some have incorporated both skills into their performances), not many ventriloquists have made it far on the show. These ventriloquists have proven themselves as some of the best in the game due to their Got Talent history and beyond.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The 6 Best Ventriloquists in ‘America’s Got Talent’ History</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Jamie Leahey</h3><p>Hailing from Britain’s Got Talent is kid ventriloquist Jamie Leahey. After his successful BGT run he took the AGT stage for the spin off series AGT All-Stars. Although he didn’t make it into the finale of AGT All-Stars it’s clear he has a huge career ahead of him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/qAgmepVpoIk</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Celia Muñoz</h3><p>After rising to fame on Spain’s Got Talent, Celia Muñoz traveled to America to compete on America’s Got Talent. She impressed throughout the weeks of the competition and even went on to win the wildcard place in the finale. Although she didn’t win, she’s created a name for herself and solidified her place as a fan favorite. Unlike others on the show, Muñoz never brought a puppet to the stage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/amMxvPO0JBI</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Jack Williams</h3><p>Ahead of Jack William’s journey on AGT, he had already been known on TikTok, as a ventriloquist that “threw” his puppets voice. He was followed by over a million people before his audition aired in 2022. Although William’s ventriloquism was incredible, he didn’t make it past the semifinals round.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Ana-Maria Mărgean</h3><p>Ana-Maria Mărgean rose to fame after winning Romania’s Got Talent, she traveled to America for AGT All-Stars in 2023. Her preliminary episode solidified her spot as an impeccable performer. Not only was she able to sing, she had a great sense of humor.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/PyRshHzb9s0</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Terry Fator</h3><p>As the Season 2 champion, Terry wasn’t only the first ventriloquist to win AGT, he was also the first to incorporate singing into his act. And for a long time, Terry was known as the winner with the most mainstream success, having held his Vegas residency for years now. His signature puppet, Winston the Impersonating Turtle, allows him to show off his wide range of vocal abilities.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Darci Lynne Farmer</h3><p>Darci became the first female ventriloquist in AGT history to make the live shows when Mel B pushed the Golden Buzzer for her in the Season 12 auditions. She went on to win the season and place second on America’s Got Talent: The Champions, and even star in her own NBC Christmas special. Darci has been touring around the United States with her act ever since her big win and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/naked-men-do-towel-dance-220x147.jpg alt="Top Naked Men’s Towel Dances on ‘Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZm1dl7K0wIyvnKesop65sL3Uoqqtq12eu26tzJ6popuRqHqou9Nmq5qklaPBbrTIrKuoqqlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
