No&nbsp;one knows this better than Hollywood actress and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Devil Wears Prada</i></a> star, <a href=# title="Emily Blunt" data-link=tag>Emily Blunt</a>. The British actress had a&nbsp;stutter when she was a&nbsp;child, which was so&nbsp;bad that she couldn’t even say her own name. But she was able to&nbsp;overcome this and has become one of&nbsp;the most successful actors in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>Emily Blunt struggled with stuttering as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e4/299/c8aefb5237a19cf0b84bef5e31.jpg><p>Stuttering is&nbsp;hereditary, and many people in&nbsp;Emily Blunt’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>family</a> before her had this issue. Her stutter started when she was 6&nbsp;or 7&nbsp;years old, then it&nbsp;got worse as&nbsp;she got older.<br></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef3/989/cb638f53bf974441a8c6fec75f.jpg><p>While she felt it&nbsp;was only part of&nbsp;who she was, others used it&nbsp;to&nbsp;define her, and she found that really tough. She struggled to&nbsp;speak in&nbsp;class and even found it&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;pronounce her own <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>name</a>. She explained, “It&nbsp;feels like you’ve got this imposter living in&nbsp;your body.”</p><p><h2>But her stutter also led her to&nbsp;acting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/100/212/b046d95d9a8ea3b7dbb30ab6cc.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/713/c31/7c1c4f5ca5a66a585b5b1e0e3a.jpg><p>She found that she could speak more smoothly if&nbsp;she didn’t sound like herself, so&nbsp;she used to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;funny <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>voices</a> and accents in&nbsp;school. And then, when she was&nbsp;12, her teacher asked her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the class play and even suggested she do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different accent to&nbsp;help her. She did just that and managed to&nbsp;speak fluently.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;fact, acting helped her to&nbsp;overcome her impediment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e2/173/21eecf5cf691b6130ebe7231aa.jpg><p>She began to&nbsp;discover that the more she lost herself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;character, the less <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>self-conscious</a> she became, and her stutter diminished. She found the experience “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>liberating</a>,” and it&nbsp;fostered her love of&nbsp;acting and helped her discover her voice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3dd/509/35113850a59cb6a58c7c6f9922.jpg><p>That play was the beginning of&nbsp;her realizing that she could <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>handle</a> her stutter and maybe “grow past this.” And then she was discovered while doing a&nbsp;play, and she started auditioning for acting jobs. Since then, she has fallen in&nbsp;love with it&nbsp;even more.</p><p><h2>Though she still struggles sometimes, she has learned a&nbsp;lot.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/085/3eb/4f8ce950129692e0ce0554278b.png><p>Her stutter can still flare&nbsp;up, like if&nbsp;she is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tired</a>, filming a&nbsp;stressful scene, or&nbsp;when she was pregnant. But she doesn’t even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>consider</a> her stutter when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;choosing her roles. When acting, you access a&nbsp;different part of&nbsp;your brain than when speaking as&nbsp;yourself. Blunt finds that removing herself from the situation and <a href=# title=empathizing data-link=tag>empathizing</a> with the character frees her up&nbsp;and allows her not to&nbsp;stutter in&nbsp;her work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/004/c5e/324c3c5fb8b402bfc9760a9296.jpg><p>Her husband, <a href=# title="John Krasinski" data-link=tag>John Krasinski</a>, has<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> stated</a> what a&nbsp;powerful actor and person he&nbsp;thinks his wife&nbsp;is. “The air changes in&nbsp;the room when she starts doing what she does,” he&nbsp;said. “It’s so&nbsp;honest and so&nbsp;pure and so&nbsp;powerful. It’s like a&nbsp;superpower.”</p><p><h2>Her challenges as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child changed her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b4/3bc/03589c5a7db79cbee5c7514c05.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child with a&nbsp;speech impediment, Blunt was less inclined to&nbsp;speak, so&nbsp;she became a&nbsp;very good listener and an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>observant</a> child. She absorbed the world in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different way than most people. She credits her stutter with making her an&nbsp;empathetic person. She believes that what she went through helped her establish a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;kindness, both toward herself and others.</p><p>She has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoken</a> about how having the support of&nbsp;her husband has helped her on&nbsp;her journey: “Meeting John really changed my&nbsp;life... When I&nbsp;feel the support that&nbsp;I have from him, I&nbsp;feel invincible. There’s someone behind you on&nbsp;your good days and someone in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you on&nbsp;your bad days,” said Blunt.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;has impacted what she teaches her kids.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/231/d19/ada44158da9642cc5c9e96df3d.jpg><p>Emily now has 2&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>daughters</a> with her husband John Krasinski, Hazel and Violet. Their motto at&nbsp;home is&nbsp;“Be&nbsp;brave, be&nbsp;kind.” Because of&nbsp;her challenges, she teaches her kids that making <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mistakes</a>, or&nbsp;having difficulties that cause you to&nbsp;make mistakes, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good thing because it’s how you learn and grow. And she always encourages <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>empathy</a> in&nbsp;her kids, teaching them to&nbsp;embrace people’s differences.</p><p><h2>She now uses her platform to&nbsp;empower children with stutters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0a/b5c/6c167f59b393002fef7aca1c4c.jpg><p>Blunt believes that stuttering is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>misunderstood</a> condition, and many children who struggle can be&nbsp;teased for&nbsp;it. She explained, “You’ve got to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love with the fact that you’ve got a&nbsp;stutter to&nbsp;accept&nbsp;it. But it’s not all of&nbsp;you.”</p><p>She wants people to&nbsp;understand that it&nbsp;isn’t because they are nervous, it’s a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>genetic</a> condition, and to&nbsp;empower people with a&nbsp;positive outlook&nbsp;— it&nbsp;isn’t that they stutter badly, but rather, they should think of&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;“I’m a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brilliant</a> stutterer.” She calls her work to&nbsp;help the stuttering <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>community</a> her “greatest pleasure” because of&nbsp;her personal experience.</p><p>What was your biggest challenge as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid? And how did it&nbsp;impact you as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person? What advice from your childhood would you pass down to&nbsp;your kids?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMawwdWeZKCnpGLBqbXSZqCmqJ%2Bowaa%2BjKKlZrGfqr9urs6dsGagn6x6prnIpbBmmpyqu7V506uYp6uWpL%2BuscNmn56qXZi1qrjDoaaonF2eurGxw6KknqakYravwM5mn6iknK7EsLvDZqqtmaKZvK55l2lubGlgZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
