It is difficult but not impossible.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The corporate keke driver</p><p>Mr <strong>Samuel Ogundare</strong> is that needle in the haystack. Ogundare is not your average Lagos tricycle driver. Here is his story.</p><p>Why is he different?</p><p>For one, his dress code is more suited for a GQ photoshoot than driving on the rough roads of Lagos.</p><p>When Pulse met him in Shitta, Surulere, he was wearing a white shirt, black blazer, bow tie and a pair of suede wingtip shoes.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Samuel Ogundare is a 5'6 man, with a clean shave, a great haircut and a certain swagger that you rarely see with commercial transporters.</p><p>His keke is not the average dirty tricycle. It has a sound and visual system. It also has brown leather seats, a hand towel and specially tailored carpets in the right areas with a phone camera. It doesn't stop there. His Keke also has a ceiling fan.</p><p>Ogundare is also present on social media. He has an Instagram, Facebook and Twitter account for his one-of-a-kind keke.</p><p>His sharp sense of style and packaging was the subject of attraction on Twitter recently. It’s not every day you see a keke driver dressed like an investment banker with a posh Keke.</p><p>Ogundare’s business strategy has garnered his names like "corporate guy" and&nbsp; "Kowope," on the streets of Surulere.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I know people look down on Keke drivers and think they don't know anything. This is what I do, and if I don't stand out, and act like everyone else, how will anyone take me seriously?"</p><p>"I like what I do and I enjoy it. I don't like to think anyone is better than me." he continues.</p><p>When I asked whether it was a marketing tactic, he says, "Yes and no. This is me being who I am. I like dressing well. But yes, it is also so people look at me differently."</p><p>Financial reward</p><p>Ogundare has two kekes and each one costs N650,000.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>How much does he make in a day?</p><p>"Usually, it's about N5,000 but on the good days, I make N7,000, N8, 000," he says.</p><p>"I come out at 9 (am) and I work till 2-3 (pm) and go pick the children assigned to me from school. I close at 5:30 pm every day” he further says.</p><p>His beginnings</p><p>"I completed my Secondary School exams in 2013 - that's five years ago. My older brother, also a Keke driver asked me to come to Lagos” he tells Pulse.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He continues, "When I arrived, I got a Keke on hire-purchase. I worked with it for four years and saved up each day."</p><p>God as his father</p><p>One easily perceivable thing in all our conversations was, "God". So I asked him whether he was a Christian.</p><p>It turns out he is an instrumentalist and as we later discussed in camera, his "Father in the lord," helped him realise how he could stand out of the crowd.</p><p>He plays the talking drum and goes to church every other day. His church connects have also helped his growing popularity around the Surulere, Ojuelegba area.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It underlines the power of referrals. When trust is built, business tends to work itself as someone will talk to another who needs a solution you can provide.</p><p>That's why Ogundare transports over five children a day across Surulere. Their parents have complete trust in him.</p><p>Admirers and growing popularity</p><p>Being a guy with a growing reputation, admirers are bound to come. He says passively as if it meant nothing that, "I just want to make my money and go but I like them, it means they appreciate what I do."</p><p>He continues, "I just try to stay humble, but those people have helped me a lot with social media posts and other things."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On women, he says, "I have no girlfriend, but I will when the time is right."</p><p>Would he take another job?</p><p>Interestingly, Ogundare says no. He says he loves his job and wouldn't change it for a thing. Instead, he says he would invest heavily in this business and watch it all yield results.</p><p>He's a sensation and people are taking notice fast. Politicians are also coming in. Ogundare has an employee that drives his second keke. His name is <strong>John Kelechi</strong> who he hired earlier in the year.</p><p>His end goal</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Ogundare plans to go back to school for a degree in Business Administration.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miknqyipHyttcWeZKKmXaOuqrbAZqSenaRiwamxjJymq6ifp661sYyknKSdXZm%2FqsLEq2SwoJ9iuqK3xKxkp3BgZX1uvMSrZJ2ZqWSFu7bQsKux</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
