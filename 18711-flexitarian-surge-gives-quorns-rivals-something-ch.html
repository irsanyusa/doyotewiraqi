One reason the brand has offered for this impressive jump is the growing popularity of the ‘flexitarian’ diet – namely, people reducing meat consumption in favour of other sustainable protein sources.
YouGov data certainly backs-up the general theory that people are becoming more inclined to look to such alternatives in their diets."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Back in April, our <a href=#>Meat and Poultry report</a> showed that over half (56%) of British consumers say they don’t need meat to have a good meal. The study also indicated that of those that are eating less meat, a third (32%) say it is directly due to them trying out more vegetarian meals.</p><p>In terms of brand perception, Quorn has experienced an upturn in recent years. Its overall Impression score (whether someone has a positive impression of the brand) has grown from +6 in July 2012 to 15 now.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/new20quorn.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>This change in impression score may well have something to do with its strong marketing campaign. The company replaced long-time Quorn Foods promoter Mo Farah with other sports stars such as Olympic swimming champion Adam Peaty, who features in one of its recent large scale advertising efforts.</p><p>Its Ad Awareness score (whether someone has seen an advert for the brand in the last two weeks) grew from +7 to +18 between early January to the start of March.</p><p>But it isn’t just a case of being noticed; over the past year consumers’ view of the brand’s quality has also improved. Quorn’s Quality score is now +16, four points higher than it showed 12 months ago.</p><p>All of this has culminated in an increase in the percentage of people who say they would consider purchasing one of the brand’s products. Quorn’s Purchase Consideration score reached a high of +24 in late June, up 6 points from the same point in 2016.</p><p>So while it may be true to suggest consumers’ habits are altering, Quorn Foods has been able to position itself effectively in order to capitalise.</p><p>This article originally appeared in City A.M.</p><p>Image PA</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYW2Ecn2Mn6OesJmprrO1wKdkrK2inLJus8ivnKxloaq8s7rSZqmirpGhwG6%2FzqacraCZo7Rur8c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
