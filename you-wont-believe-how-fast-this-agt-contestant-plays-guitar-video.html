The 18-year-old Polish guitarist showed off talent like we’ve never seen before, wowing the judges in his audition.</strong></p><p>Marcin made it all the way to the semifinals last year.

He made sure to tell everyone that he wasn’t a singer, although he would be playing guitar.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>INSANE GUITARIST ALEXANDR MISKO’S COVER OF ‘THE REAL SLIM SHADY’ IS GOING VIRAL [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>The young guitarist went on to shock the judges and audience with his skills. Marcin quickly strummed the guitar and added percussion by knocking on it. Just when you think he’s done, he just adds more complexity to the performance.</p><p>Both the AGT judges and the crowd gave Marcin a standing ovation for his audition. Simon Cowell said he tried learning guitar as a teenager, but it didn’t go well for him. He said most people who audition with guitar “can’t play the guitar,” and said Marcin showed off “what that thing was actually invented for.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>‘Got Talent’ Musicians Do More Than Just Sing</h3><p>“You didn’t play the guitar, you murdered the guitar,” Howie Mandel told Marcin.
