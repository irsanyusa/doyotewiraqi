But there are some other words and phrases you need to keep for your off-duty hours!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5 English slang words for informal use</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Guys</h3><p>A ‘guy’ is an informal word for a man, however it also has become a bit of a lazy way of referring to a single person regardless of gender, though people who identify as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">womxn </a>generally don’t like being referred to as a ‘guy’. When you’re using this to be a collective noun for a group of people, as in ‘all the guys say’, it used to mean a non-gender specific way of referring to a group, but it still has a very male feeling to the word. For a more non-gendered approach to group nouns, try ‘everyone’, ‘people’, ‘pals’, ‘peeps’, or ‘folks’. Regardless, it’s not something you should use at work.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">30 fun facts about the English language</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Sucks or lame</h3><p>Both words mean something that is not very good. To say something ‘sucked’, ‘is sucky’ or ‘is lame’ is a very juvenile way of describing something as bad and disappointing. ‘Sucking’ has nothing to do with the actual meaning of the verb, which is a very specific way of attaching, think of a suction cup attaching to a wall. If I walked into a pole while looking at my phone, in front of a bus full of people, I might say to my friend ‘that really sucked’. It was bad, and it was very disappointing that it happened. It came out of California surfer speak in the 1980s, and is very informal<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> American slang</a> that isn’t appropriate in a work context.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Busted</h3><p>This very American word has a couple of different meanings. As a verb, it’s used in the past tense to mean getting caught doing something. For example: ‘I got busted trying to sneak in late.’ It can also mean something is broken, for example: ‘Don’t use that printer, it’s busted.’ In both cases, it’s very informal, and not right for work! Just use ‘caught’ in the first instance, like ‘I got caught trying to sneak in late’. For the second usage, try ‘broken’ or ‘not working’, for example: ‘Don’t use that printer, it’s not working.’</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swearing in English: What is really offensive?</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Bloke or mate</h3><p>These are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British slang</a> words to refer to a person. ‘Bloke’ means a nonspecific male person, where you might you ‘guy’ in an American context though it hasn’t developed to include women in any way. ‘Mate’ is a friend, or someone you’re being friendly with, mostly. They are both very informal words you would only use with your friends, never in a work context. Again, find a non-gendered word to mean a person, and ‘person’ is good! ‘Mate’ isn’t really one you’d use in a work context unless it’s very informal, and as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve explained before</a>, it’s a tricky one so you need to be very sure before you use it.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Piss</h3><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British people</a> have many uses for the word ‘piss’, and none of them are okay in a work context. It’s a bit of a rude word really, and not my favourite to hear, and the word itself means ‘to urinate’. But there are several phrases it’s good to at least know: taking the piss, being pissed, and going for a piss.</p><ul><li>‘Taking the piss’ means someone is making fun of you, or mildly insulting you, or both. You may ask ‘are you taking the piss?’ which is a way of asking whether you’re saying something really stupid or are you making fun of me.</li><li>‘Being pissed’ refers to being drunk, so you could say ‘he was really pissed last night’.</li><li>‘Going for a piss’ actually refers to going to the toilet to urinate, but it’s a not very pleasant way of saying it. We don’t need the details of what you might do in the toilet!&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As you can see, none of these are phrases you want to use at your workplace, but are, mostly, fine with your friends.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Erin-2-2.jpeg><h2>Erin McGann</h2><p>Erin McGann is a Canadian freelance writer focusing on travel, living abroad, parenting, history, and culture.
