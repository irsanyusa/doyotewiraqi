Pterodactyls fly over their heads as&nbsp;they try to&nbsp;avoid the blast wave that will soon cover the <a href=# title=Earth data-link=tag>Earth</a>.</p><p>This event happened about <strong>66&nbsp;million years ago</strong>. It&nbsp;wiped out almost every living thing on&nbsp;Earth. Birds and flying dinosaurs were just about the only ones who could survive the most massive extinction event ever. Hey don’t blame&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;wasn’t around then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c74/290/89fbe453a39f6da52c002d5b81.jpeg><p>Let’s go&nbsp;down their evolutionary tree to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the world’s first bird&nbsp;— <strong>Archaeopteryx</strong>. It&nbsp;was about the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;modern raven, but it&nbsp;looked like a&nbsp;small dinosaur with feathers. It&nbsp;had many small conical teeth, almost like alligators. It’s because Archaeopteryx was closer to&nbsp;reptiles than to&nbsp;birds. However, its <a href=# title=brain data-link=tag>brain</a> was three times larger than that of&nbsp;these reptiles.<strong> </strong>Although it&nbsp;had <a href=# title=wings data-link=tag>wings</a> with feathers, it&nbsp;could hardly fly like modern birds. Its shoulder joints didn’t allow it&nbsp;to&nbsp;lift its wings above its back. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;couldn’t make a&nbsp;full wingbeat. Most likely, Archaeopteryx was capable of&nbsp;gliding flights with small wing flaps. Evolution has led to&nbsp;more evolved species capable of&nbsp;full flight.</p><p><strong>Pterodactyls</strong>. These guys had no&nbsp;feathers, but membranes made of&nbsp;skin and muscle. Its wingspan was about the length of&nbsp;a&nbsp;human leg. It&nbsp;could fly perfectly and catch <a href=# title=fish data-link=tag>fish</a> and small <a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a>. Although flying dinosaurs could easily outrun terrestrial predators like velociraptors and T-Rexes, most of&nbsp;them didn’t make it&nbsp;through the impact of&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant meteorite. Let’s look at&nbsp;this event step by&nbsp;step to&nbsp;see how they got to&nbsp;our time. <strong>Ten minutes before the meteorite crash</strong>. A&nbsp;massive <a href=# title=rock data-link=tag>rock</a> about the size of&nbsp;Manhattan Island is&nbsp;moving towards Earth in&nbsp;space. It&nbsp;weighs <strong>460 trillion tons</strong>. That’s like <strong>three trillion blue whales</strong>, the heaviest mammals that ever lived on&nbsp;Earth. And it’s approaching our planet at&nbsp;12&nbsp;miles per second. At&nbsp;that speed, it&nbsp;could cross the Atlantic Ocean in&nbsp;just <strong>4.5&nbsp;minutes</strong>. That’s twice as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;our modern spacecraft can fly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/a41/e99/1ef1c3511482a36d1b24288e85.jpeg><p><strong>Five seconds before the meteorite crash</strong>. Ooh, this is&nbsp;getting tense. The Earth’s gravitational force continues to&nbsp;pull the giant meteorite. It&nbsp;blows a&nbsp;hole in&nbsp;our atmosphere and creates a&nbsp;popping sound so&nbsp;loud you could hear it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;our planet. All the animals on&nbsp;our planet wake up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;panic. They lift their heads up&nbsp;and see a&nbsp;huge rock that begins to&nbsp;burn through the air. Smaller fragments start to&nbsp;break away from the main meteorite. This fire is&nbsp;so&nbsp;bright that it&nbsp;shines almost like the Sun. Flying dinosaurs and other ancestors of&nbsp;modern birds are the first to&nbsp;sense danger. They make a&nbsp;beeline to&nbsp;the sky and try to&nbsp;fly as&nbsp;far away from the impact site as&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;save their lives.</p><p>The <strong>moment of&nbsp;impact</strong>. The colossal mass and velocity of&nbsp;the meteorite give it&nbsp;an&nbsp;enormous amount of&nbsp;<a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a>. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;it&nbsp;touches the Earth, it&nbsp;causes an&nbsp;explosion of&nbsp;<strong>150 trillion tons of&nbsp;TNT</strong>. The blast wave literally rips out chunks of&nbsp;our planet and throws them&nbsp;up. A&nbsp;huge wall of&nbsp;energy begins to&nbsp;move from the point of&nbsp;impact in&nbsp;all directions. It&nbsp;snatches the trees out with the roots and pushes them to&nbsp;the ground like dominoes. The shock wave completely wraps around our planet. This energy turns into heat. Everything around the impact site begins to&nbsp;ignite, green jungles and trees turn to&nbsp;smoldering charcoal in&nbsp;seconds. The ground and rocks simply evaporate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/f6f/deb/876cfa540bb338fd03b75a04e4.jpeg><p>The collision caused a&nbsp;massive <a href=# title=earthquake data-link=tag>earthquake</a>. Some dinosaurs may have fallen into cracks that appeared in&nbsp;the ground. A&nbsp;strong earthquake caused a&nbsp;tsunami with waves higher than the Empire State Building. Dinosaurs that weren’t trapped in&nbsp;the burning forests were washed away by&nbsp;the enormous waves. The dinosaurs of&nbsp;North America try to&nbsp;escape by&nbsp;running to&nbsp;the North. But the blast wave inevitably catches up&nbsp;with them. Flying dinosaurs have no&nbsp;problem with earthquakes or&nbsp;tsunamis. They fly high enough to&nbsp;avoid the giant waves. But they will have to&nbsp;contend with continuously falling meteorite debris.</p><p><strong>Five minutes after the meteorite crash</strong>. A&nbsp;meteor shower of&nbsp;giant rock fragments continues to&nbsp;fall to&nbsp;Earth. Some meteorites were the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;car; others were more like a&nbsp;large building. Ashes and dust rise into the air. Their temperature is&nbsp;so&nbsp;high that they melt and turn into liquid lava and then fall back to&nbsp;Earth, causing more fires. Meteor showers caused trouble for flying dinosaurs too. They have to&nbsp;maneuver and dodge the falling red-hot rocks. The high temperatures are a&nbsp;huge problem for them because it&nbsp;might make them lose feathers. With no&nbsp;feathers, they aren’t able to&nbsp;fly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/cb3/454/85096e546c8872fa5c9ec02921.jpeg><p><strong>10&nbsp;hours after the meteorite crash.</strong> The dinosaurs continuously ran North all this time. They found themselves in&nbsp;unfamiliar territory with many swamps. Giant dinosaurs like T-Rexes have legs as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult’s human height. They have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;get through this terrain. But if&nbsp;they fell, they could never get back&nbsp;up. The smaller dinosaurs, like <strong>Triceratops</strong>, had short legs and couldn’t go&nbsp;through the dense swamps.</p><p><strong>1&nbsp;month after the meteorite crash.</strong>&nbsp;15&nbsp;trillion tons of&nbsp;ash were ejected into our atmosphere. A&nbsp;giant cloud blocked the Sun, and the Earth was immersed in&nbsp;complete darkness. Surviving <a href=# title=plants data-link=tag>plants</a> couldn’t feed on&nbsp;the sun’s energy and stopped producing oxygen. Surviving dinosaurs can hardly breathe because of&nbsp;the lack of&nbsp;air and a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;dust. The lack of&nbsp;sunshine in&nbsp;the sky made phytoplankton disappear. Many marine animals were left without their only source of&nbsp;food. The dust and ashes in&nbsp;the atmosphere prevent our planet from getting heat from the Sun, and the temperature here is&nbsp;beginning to&nbsp;drop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/07b/3c6/9e9ad55a1a954266a92905f0a3.jpeg><p>The place where the meteorite fell was rich in&nbsp;sulfur. This toxic acid evaporated at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the impact and formed in&nbsp;clouds. Now there are acid rains on&nbsp;Earth. Flying dinosaurs now have to&nbsp;hide from these rains. They have to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;caves and can’t go&nbsp;outside to&nbsp;get some food. So&nbsp;far, a&nbsp;large number of&nbsp;terrestrial and flying dinosaurs have survived. They come out to&nbsp;see the aftermath of&nbsp;the disaster. The site of&nbsp;the impact was in&nbsp;present-day Mexico, the Yucatán Peninsula. The <strong>Chicxulub crater</strong> is&nbsp;located here. It’s about 93&nbsp;miles wide, like half of&nbsp;all of&nbsp;Lake Michigan! And it’s 12&nbsp;miles deep. You could plunge the whole Mount Everest in&nbsp;there, and there would still be&nbsp;6.5 miles of&nbsp;available space.</p><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t the impact itself that made the dinosaurs disappear. The fire destroyed most of&nbsp;the plants the herbivorous dinosaurs ate. With no&nbsp;food, their numbers dwindled rapidly. Predatory dinosaurs had nothing to&nbsp;eat either. Acid rain and the disappearance of&nbsp;phytoplankton threatened all marine life. Even though birds managed to&nbsp;avoid the blast waves and tsunami, they were short of&nbsp;food too. About&nbsp;<strong>80%</strong> of&nbsp;all birds didn’t make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the extinction event.</p><p>The problem was that all the forests on&nbsp;Earth were wiped out. Most birds would nest and live in&nbsp;trees. Besides that, the forests were always full of&nbsp;food, from all kinds of&nbsp;ants and termites to&nbsp;flying insects and small mice. So&nbsp;only those species that lived on&nbsp;the ground and could fly well survived. Most likely, they fed on&nbsp;the seeds of&nbsp;small surviving plants. This habit made flying dinosaurs lose their teeth during evolution. Instead of&nbsp;jaws with a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;sharp teeth, they got long beaks to&nbsp;grab tiny seeds from the ground.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/a36/30e/750e6c51118a92c1cf40a0cf4f.jpeg><p>Although Earth looks like a&nbsp;terrible place to&nbsp;live now, there’s an&nbsp;evolutionary boom for birds. They have to&nbsp;travel long distances in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;food. Their wings get stronger. They also feel safe from predators who regarded them as&nbsp;food before. No&nbsp;T-Rex now catches a&nbsp;sleeping bird off guard. About&nbsp;<strong>1,000 years after the collision</strong>, the first dense forests appear. It&nbsp;gives another big boost to&nbsp;evolution. A&nbsp;<strong>million years later</strong>, forests full of&nbsp;food are populated by&nbsp;the ancestors of&nbsp;modern mousebirds. And <strong>65&nbsp;million years later</strong>, in&nbsp;modern times, we&nbsp;have about <strong>10,000 species of&nbsp;birds</strong>. Pigeons, crows, eagles, and hawks. Even penguins. These are all descendants of&nbsp;the dinosaurs.</p><p>But there were other survivors. Some alligator and crocodile ancestors were able to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;changing conditions. About&nbsp;80% of&nbsp;turtle species managed to&nbsp;survive the mass extinction, and now their descendants live among&nbsp;us. Snakes and lizards were also able to&nbsp;wait out the hard times in&nbsp;their burrows. Even some mammals, like <strong>monotremes</strong>, survived. This hedgehog-sized animal was able to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;evolve. Many millions of&nbsp;years later, these mammals evolved into primates, which later gave life to&nbsp;modern humans. Much, much later, came the iPhone.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLOtxcinnmacmaO8tK3Uq6pmq6Wnw6rCxJ1koZ2imsBuw8eeqZ5lpJ2yunnAq5xmn5%2Bjsm6EkG9qaW5f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
