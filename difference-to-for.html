These two tiny <a href=#>prepositions</a> are incredibly useful for a variety of situations in English. In this article, we’ll teach you when to use “to” and “for” correctly. We’ll review some distinct&nbsp; ways to use “to” and “for”, and then we’ll go over some examples&nbsp; that often <a href=#>confuse</a> learners of English. So, without further ado, here’s the difference between “for” and “to” in English.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-to-use-“to”>When to use “to”</h2><p>This list below is not exhaustive. in fact, if we mentioned all&nbsp; the different ways you can use “to”, we’d need to turn this article&nbsp; into a book. But these five examples should be a good primer.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Sending greetings or expressing wishes</h3><p>Say hi <strong>to</strong> Andy from me.&nbsp;<br>Happy birthday <strong>to </strong>you!&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Destination or movement</h3><p>We’re going <strong>to</strong> New York today.&nbsp;<br>This bus is going <strong>to </strong>the depot.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Comparatives</h3><p>We prefer the mountains <strong>to </strong>the beach.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Time and numbers</h3><p>It’s five <strong>to</strong> seven.&nbsp;<br>A house in this area costs $200,000 <strong>to</strong> $250,000 on average.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. After some nouns, verbs and adjectives</h3><p>Do you know the answer <strong>to</strong> the question?<br>I’m looking forward <strong>to</strong> seeing you.&nbsp;<br>Please be kind <strong>to</strong> the children.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=When-to-use-“for”>When to use “for”</h2><p>Here are three ways we use “for”. Again, there are more ways to use this preposition, but these are the most important ones to remember.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Duration and schedules</h3><p>I have lived here <strong>for</strong> ten years.&nbsp;<br>I made you an appointment <strong>for</strong> Monday.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Benefits</h3><p>Yoga is good <strong>for</strong> the mind and the body.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Support and agreement</h3><p>I am <strong>for</strong> free university education in most cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Now we’re going to look at “to” and “for” together and see how they’re used in expressions that learners often find confusing.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Reason-and-purpose>Reason and purpose</h2><p>We can use both “to” and “for” to talk about the <a href=#>reason</a> or motive for doing something. The difference lies in the grammar. Take a look at the sentences below.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>She’s in Paris <strong>for a meeting</strong> with her boss.&nbsp;</li><li>She’s in Paris <strong>to meet</strong> her boss.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The structure is <strong>for + noun</strong> and <strong>to + verb</strong>. Here’s another example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I’m here <strong>for you</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>I’m here <strong>to help</strong> you.</li></ul><p>“For” can be used with a gerund to express the purpose of an object.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I use that bowl <strong>for serving</strong> salads.&nbsp;</li><li>I use that bowl <strong>to serve </strong>salads.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Giving-and-receiving>Giving and receiving</h2><p>Many learners get confused about whether to use “to” vs. “for” when they talk about giving and buying <a href=#>gifts</a> for people. The first thing is to forget what we just said about reason and purpose – in this case, “to” is used with a noun. Use “to” when you talk about giving someone something directly.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I gave those tickets <strong>to my mum</strong> as a birthday present.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This is when the indirect object, “my mum” comes after the direct object, “those tickets”. If you change the order of the objects, you don’t need “to”.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I gave my mum those tickets as a birthday present.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Use “for” to talk about the reason for buying a gift. You can also use “for” with the verb “to buy” to talk about the recipient of a gift.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I gave those tickets to my mum <strong>for her birthday</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>She bought this <strong>for her dad</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Important-to-vs.-important-for>Important to vs. important for</h2><p>Another common error that students make is when using the structures “important to” and “important for”. Both can be correct, but the meaning of the two phrases is different. Take a look at these examples.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Meeting my long-lost relatives was really important <strong>to</strong> me.&nbsp;</li><li>Meeting the CEO is really important <strong>for</strong> me.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If something is important <strong>to</strong> you, it is personally important and holds some significance to you personally. If something is important <strong>for</strong> you, it has a benefit for you. Here is another example:&nbsp;<br>Spending time with my grandparents is really important <strong>to </strong>me, but focusing on work is important <strong>for</strong> my career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When to use to and for</h2><p>Hopefully, we’ve managed to clear up some doubts about using “to” and “for” in English. Try to remember the grammatical differences when talking about your reason for doing something – I’m learning English for work vs. I’m learning English to use <a href=#>at work</a>. You also need to remember the different ways of talking about giving and receiving and whether something is important to you or for you. (Saying your childhood teddy bear is important <strong>for</strong> you might get you some funny looks – what does it do for you?!) Remembering all of this will be good <strong>for</strong> your English!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
