Drops of&nbsp;sweat are dripping down your face. Your frightened eyes look&nbsp;up, watching a&nbsp;big flying bug. The Asian Giant Hornet, the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;thumb, is&nbsp;hovering above you.</p><p>It’s one of&nbsp;the most dangerous insects on&nbsp;the planet. And not just because its sting looks like a&nbsp;needle. This insect can cause a&nbsp;real economic crisis all over the world and lead to&nbsp;the mass extinction of&nbsp;many species of&nbsp;living creatures on&nbsp;Earth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/888/25b/69f31b54dcbbda03fac88153cb.png><p>But we&nbsp;can speak about it&nbsp;later because now, it’s going to&nbsp;sting you. The sting of&nbsp;the giant hornet is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most dangerous and painful among insects. You’re about to&nbsp;find out what happens to&nbsp;the <a href=# title="human body" data-link=tag>human body</a> after the sting pierces the skin. There’s no&nbsp;point in&nbsp;running; the hornet will catch up&nbsp;with you anyway.</p><p>It&nbsp;flies around you. You hear a&nbsp;strange crackling sound. The hornet flicks its jaws to&nbsp;scare you and keep you at&nbsp;a&nbsp;distance. After a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;seconds, it&nbsp;attacks. The hornet stings you right in&nbsp;the shoulder. Oh, it&nbsp;doesn’t care about your clothes. The stinger can pierce through a&nbsp;thick layer of&nbsp;fabric and even a&nbsp;beekeeper’s protective clothing. You need a&nbsp;special suit similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;spacesuit to&nbsp;be&nbsp;protected from the hornet. Unfortunately, you don’t have one.</p><p>In&nbsp;the beginning, you feel as&nbsp;if&nbsp;a&nbsp;red-hot needle is&nbsp;piercing your body. Through this needle, the hornet injects poison into your skin. This substance dilates the walls of&nbsp;the blood vessels around the bite, which makes your skin turn red. Your body fights the foreign substance and sends out immune cells. But the <a href=# title=venom data-link=tag>venom</a> destroys your defense cells, causing your skin to&nbsp;swell.</p><p>The infected blood is&nbsp;filtered out by&nbsp;the kidneys. The poison contains a&nbsp;substance that is&nbsp;toxic to&nbsp;this organ. But your kidneys don’t bother you as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;your shoulder. The bite site is&nbsp;swollen and red. It’s burning. The swelling can last from hours to&nbsp;days! It’s only one hornet, but it&nbsp;can sting you ten times. Just imagine what would happen if&nbsp;you stirred up&nbsp;a&nbsp;nest. You would have to&nbsp;hide in&nbsp;dense bushes or&nbsp;jump in&nbsp;the water to&nbsp;escape. If&nbsp;you get stung several times, you need to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/127/8e7/f327a65b888497ba9b7bf27b2c.png><p>In&nbsp;any case, you’re lucky that you don’t have severe consequences. People with allergies should stay away from giant hornets. The sting can be&nbsp;catastrophic for their bodies. To&nbsp;avoid coming across these monsters, stay away from their nest. You can hear an&nbsp;alarming buzzing sound from afar. Asian giant hornets are aggressive and will sting anyone who walks past their nest. Authorities always get rid of&nbsp;their nests if&nbsp;they appear within the city limits. But not only to&nbsp;stop them from attacking people but also to&nbsp;prevent the apocalypse. And here’s how it&nbsp;can happen.</p><p>One of&nbsp;Asian giant hornets’ favorite things is&nbsp;attacking beehives. They fly far away from the nest, and when they find a&nbsp;hive, they mark it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;unique pheromone. The smell attracts other hornets. And even a&nbsp;small group of&nbsp;them can completely destroy the hive. About 20&nbsp;hornets can wipe out about 30,000&nbsp;bees. Imagine the damage thousands of&nbsp;hornets can&nbsp;do! This is&nbsp;the main danger they present.</p><p>By&nbsp;transferring pollen between flowering plants, bees help them grow, breed, and produce food. Bees pollinate plants that cows and other livestock eat. Thanks to&nbsp;bees, we&nbsp;have cotton growing. If&nbsp;hornets wipe out bees, there will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;worldwide shortage of&nbsp;cotton clothing.</p><p>Simple T-shirts, jeans, and jackets will become more expensive and sooner or&nbsp;later disappear from the markets. Many berries and fruits may lose their rich taste and vitamin content. This can lead to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;vitamins not only in&nbsp;animals but also in&nbsp;humans.</p><p>You won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;your jeans and favorite shirt and go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;restaurant for a&nbsp;juicy burger. Eggplants, hot peppers, kiwis, blueberries, cranberries, and other products will disappear from the stores. Entire species of&nbsp;animals will stop existing along with plants. This will lead to&nbsp;an&nbsp;even greater crisis not only in&nbsp;agriculture but also in&nbsp;the world economy. Imagine dominoes falling one by&nbsp;one&nbsp;— that’s what it’s going to&nbsp;look like.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/914/08e/74c7bc5d91a32e72f1fe698983.png><p>Along with this, the number of&nbsp;hornets will increase. There are almost no&nbsp;animals in&nbsp;the world that could control the growth of&nbsp;the hornet population. If&nbsp;people do&nbsp;nothing, everyone will have to&nbsp;wear thick protective suits to&nbsp;walk outside. Hornets will infiltrate homes and cars and sting people and pets. Of&nbsp;course, people are aware of&nbsp;this danger and take all possible measures to&nbsp;control the population of&nbsp;hornets.</p><p>Unfortunately, bees can’t protect themselves. Their sting can’t harm hornets. Bees are much smaller, so&nbsp;they are completely defenseless. But one bee species has developed a&nbsp;fantastic way to&nbsp;resist hornets.</p><p>Meet the Japanese honey bee. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant hornet enters their hive, they instantly attack&nbsp;it, covering the enemy with their bodies. Once the hornet is&nbsp;trapped in&nbsp;this dense living cocoon, the bees begin to&nbsp;vibrate. Their shaking is&nbsp;so&nbsp;fast that they just burn the hornet. After that, the bees discard the much larger insect and go&nbsp;on&nbsp;about their business.</p><p>Well, the strategy is&nbsp;effective for one hornet, but what if&nbsp;many of&nbsp;them appear? Most likely, bees won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;cover all enemies. Besides, Japanese bees can’t teach other bees how to&nbsp;fight hornets. Fortunately, humans control the giant hornet population.</p><p>All hornets belong to&nbsp;the wasp family. And among them, the Asian Hornet is&nbsp;not the creepiest insect. How about a&nbsp;wasp that can turn other living things into zombies? “Spider-manipulating” wasps can do&nbsp;that. This tiny insect lives in&nbsp;rainforests. It&nbsp;flies between trees holding an&nbsp;egg most of&nbsp;the day and looks for the perfect host. This host will later take care of&nbsp;the offspring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0cb/368/296cca5ab4bcb6d6b0dcdca19f.png><p>The wasp examines the local fauna, sniffs, avoids predators, and... notices a&nbsp;web. The spider uses this web to&nbsp;catch other insects. But this time, the spider has become the prey itself. The wasp is&nbsp;getting closer but doesn’t sting. It&nbsp;just drops the egg on&nbsp;the spider’s abdomen and flies away. It’s done! There’s nothing the spider can do&nbsp;now since the egg is&nbsp;stuck to&nbsp;its back. The hunter probably doesn’t even feel the guest. But then the larva hatches from the egg, and the spider’s life becomes a&nbsp;nightmare.</p><p>Day after day, the wasp larva feeds on&nbsp;the spider. It&nbsp;can’t get it&nbsp;off the back because the baby wasp controls its mind. The larva has injected a&nbsp;special substance into the spider’s body. The poison has a&nbsp;terrifying effect on&nbsp;the spider’s brain. Now, the spider cares for the larva’s life more than for its own.</p><p>The spider begins to&nbsp;weave an&nbsp;unusually shaped web of&nbsp;stiffer silk. It&nbsp;makes a&nbsp;particular web pattern inside which the larva will be&nbsp;safe. Then, when the baby wasp reaches a&nbsp;certain level of&nbsp;development, it&nbsp;abandons the exhausted spider and clings to&nbsp;the web. Then, it&nbsp;creates a&nbsp;cocoon that will become its home for a&nbsp;while. When the time comes, the wasp emerges from the cocoon. It&nbsp;can fly and is&nbsp;now able to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Whether it’s a&nbsp;female or&nbsp;a&nbsp;male wasp, the insect starts looking for a&nbsp;mate to&nbsp;create offspring. Then, if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;female, it&nbsp;lays an&nbsp;egg, grabs&nbsp;it, and begins flying around the jungle looking for a&nbsp;new spider.</p><p>There are even more inventive parasitic wasps. Meet one of&nbsp;them! When the female is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;lay her eggs, she starts looking for a&nbsp;babysitter. Aha, a&nbsp;ladybug. The wasp flies up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the beetle and releases a&nbsp;single egg through its sting. When the larva goes out of&nbsp;the egg, it&nbsp;makes its way inside its host.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6fd/c5e/6d1f235d4c90a00454b58abc14.png><p>Twenty days have passed. During this time, the larva has developed inside the ladybug, and now it’s getting out. But, the “babysitter’s” job isn’t done yet. The larva creates a&nbsp;cocoon between the ladybug’s hind legs. Inside&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;will evolve into an&nbsp;adult wasp. But to&nbsp;keep the cocoon safe, the larva makes a&nbsp;bodyguard out of&nbsp;its host.</p><p>If&nbsp;something dares to&nbsp;come close, the ladybug will do&nbsp;its best to&nbsp;protect the cocoon. When the wasp inside the cocoon is&nbsp;formed, it&nbsp;leaves its bodyguard. The way the wasp controls the ladybug’s mind is&nbsp;still unknown.</p><p>There are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;parasites besides wasps. Some of&nbsp;them can control animals and even humans!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmn5qooJq7tHnWoZynZZGjeqK%2FyJqlZp%2BZlru1eceoqaedpGLAtbXNoKpmsZ%2Bqenl9k29vcGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
