This mother-daughter duo made it all the way to the semifinals before facing elimination. Here’s what they’re up to now in 2022.</strong></p><p>Honey (14) and Sammy (43) began their audition by acknowledging that Honey filled out the application for them to join the series. She explained that she filled it out because they began performing together when her mom was diagnosed with breast cancer (which she was now recovered from). Since then, it was always their thing to perform together, whether in a car or at a friend’s party.</p><p>The ladies originally sang “She Used to Be Mine” by Sara Bareilles, but quickly were stopped by Simon Cowell. They then left stage to learn “Lost Without You” by Freya Ridings. The duo came back to the stage quicker than expected, explaining that Sammy still had the lyrics written on her hand. This performance was truly their moment, their love from one another radiated throughout each moment of the song.</p><p>The judges gave them a rightfully deserved standing ovation. Once positive notes were said about the song, Amanda Holden hit the Golden Buzzer for them. While Honey and Sammy didn’t make it past their <a href=#>semifinal performance</a>, their audition will truly never be forgotten.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-honey-and-sammy-up-to-now>What Are Honey and Sammy Up To Now?</h2><p>While on Britain’s Got Talent, Honey and Sammy created a joint Instagram account. During this time they shared both photos and videos of them singing and dancing. While some videos were throwbacks, others were new.</p><p>In May 2021, Honey released her debut single, in which her mother is not credited on. The single is entitled “<a href=#>Run Away</a>” is available on Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube. This song currently has over 3,000 streams on YouTube, as well as 10,000 on Spotify. According to Sammy’s post on the release date, this song had been written way before the pandemic.</p><p>In current day, Honey and Sammy don’t post as many videos together. It appears that Honey may be venturing into a new career path following the release of her single. Exactly a year after her single was released, their joint Instagram page posted about Honey’s involvement in <a href=# class=broken_link>pageantry</a>. She is competing in October for the Miss Teen Great Britain crown on behalf of Essex. In the recent photo she is wearing a sash that says “Miss Teen Essex 2022” on it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" readability=3><p>https://www.tiktok.com/@honeyharrison_x/video/7081360991996431622?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7051959652032448005</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NUP_197409_02157.jpg alt="All the Artists Competing in The ‘American Song Contest’ Finale, Who Are You Voting For?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2asn2Kvs7XTmqCnq12cvLV505qjnqakYrSwuMOepWaapa%2FHpr6MpqatoJWneqWt1KCfrZ2iYrG2u4yhpqedqWKur7CMrJimpalk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
