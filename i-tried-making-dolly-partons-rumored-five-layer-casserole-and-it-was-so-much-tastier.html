The recipe called for sprinkling a bit of salt onto each layer, but to get maximum flavor the potato slices can also be soaked in some salted water while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>Seasoning the meat is also a game-changer.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-1d0da1eb-7aa4-438c-90e9-32440e11d35c data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/v57ktktTURBXy8zNTVkNDNkYS1iNjZlLTQyMTItYTc4ZS01ODM4OGY4N2VmMDUucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Nasha Smith</p><p>I am a huge fan of marinating and pre-seasoning meats. Just like with the potatoes, I chose to add the suggested salt and pepper to the ground beef in addition to some diced up onion and peppers I took from the slices needed for the dish. I even threw in a dash of mixed herbs for good measure.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>I added crushed tomatoes to the meat.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-b2f43bea-634b-4a12-831a-77cebceba6f3 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/KuRktktTURBXy9iMGIxZDA4MC0wYzUzLTQ1YzItYmZiNS1kZjEzZjZkYWNjNWMucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>Nasha Smith</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>When I read the cooking process for this dish it immediately reminded me of scalloped potatoes, minus the creamy sauce and cheese. This dish had no liquid component for binding but there was the option to use tomato slices or a can of crushed tomatoes. I decided to use both and adding the crushed tomatoes to the meat to created a sauce-like consistency.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>Theres nothing wrong with improvising.</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-69eb371c-843c-47c3-9adb-b5c0c37c2aae data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/kIYktktTURBXy83Zjg3Y2YzYi1kMjI0LTRkZWMtYmM3OC0wYzM5ZTRlNzhjODUucG5nkZUCzQMWzQHGwsM></span><p>Nasha Smith</p><p>I placed my layers into a flat, buttered dish, stacking the potatoes, meat sauce, peppers, and slices of tomatoes. If you're a real stickler for the five-layer aspect, you might want to use a shallower dish. My attempt topped out at three layers.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>After all of the ingredients were layered, I was left with a bare layer of potatoes on top so I sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top to get a crunchy crust. Finally, I placed the dish into a preheated oven so it could cook for two hours.</p><p>Because the dish didn't call for the ingredients to be drenched in any liquid, the top layer of potatoes became crunchy well before baking was completed. To allow even cooking without burning the top, I covered it with foil for the rest of the time in the oven. I kept checking on it and my casserole actually took just over an hour to cook.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-22>The verdict</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-9118c29c-3605-41d2-b38a-7533de6b85f0 data-caption=" "><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/UDqktktTURBXy9hM2VhM2RkNC0wMzMzLTRlNjUtOTI3Ni01ODdiMzAzMTRmOTMucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>Nasha Smith</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I will absolutely be making this incredibly tasty dish again. The preparation time was relatively short and it's such an easy recipe to follow. Plus it was like getting all your food groups in one dish protein, carbs, and some veggies. It was also light and refreshing because it was devoid of any heavy, creamy sauces. Seasoning the meat and potatoes beforehand added lots of flavor throughout the dish.</p><p>As an added bonus, this recipe can be easily adapted to suit your tastes. You can add cheese in between the layers, chopped spinach to the meat sauce, and maybe toss in a few extra vegetables.</p><p>Looks like Dolly's scored another hit with this one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8hmq6uhlZl6rq3KoqWgZZSkua3FjKmYq6yfo8BuvtSmpqudlGKzqsLEZqOasZWneqSt0qycq6ecmnqiusNmoK1lp5bAbr%2FOZqSum5hiwaK%2F06Kcq2eWr8S5uZaz</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
