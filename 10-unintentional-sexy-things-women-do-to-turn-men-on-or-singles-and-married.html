These make the guys go crazy for us. That's how sexy we are – we're sexy without even trying, without even knowing that we're sexy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>1.) Loving your body: </strong>Because men love what they see, it's fascinating to them to see a woman who just loves the way she is and is super confident about her body. As a woman, love your curves,&nbsp; your sharp angles and your soft edges. Also, love your scars, your stretch marks, your best features, and your problem areas. These only make you a confident beautiful woman.</p><p><strong>2.) Having a sense of humor:</strong> There is nothing sexier than bringing laughter into someone's sad day, week or even life. You might have a ribald sense of humor, a sharp and witty one, or a low-key, dry sense of humor – whatever it is, it's hot… To men, of course!</p><p><strong>3.) Showing off your intelligence:</strong> Spotlighting your brilliance is super sexy. No need to show-off or behave like you know it all. Being smart and knowing you're right will make someone always think you're being pretentious&nbsp; but who cares!? Never hold back your intelligence. Never be ashamed of how smart you are.</p><p><strong>4.) Being optimistic:</strong> Being positive with everything doesn't just make someone like being around you but you also get to encourage him/her to see life in another light - positive light! No man wants a woman who always think the worse about everything. Trust me.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>5.) The eyes have it all: </strong>Nothing like the eyes… big, wet, loving and pretty. One look and he comes running.</p><p><strong>6.) Flicking your hair: </strong>Some of us (women) do this with no motive behind our actions. Even with short hair some of us still do it and it always stands out because there's just something sexy about it. It may sound shallow but men believe its sexy.</p><p><strong>7.) A simple touch to the chest: </strong>Just like a smile, sometimes the natural things are just the sexiest. Only guys can really explain how they feel when her hands run through their chests…especially if they're shirtless.</p><p><strong>8.) Biting your lower lip:</strong> Even movie directors use this act for the seduction scenes. It works magic on men!</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>9.) standing on your toes:</strong> This is sexy as h***! Even when a woman is just trying to get something from the upper shelve… almost all the men will think of kissing or running to help her out. It drives them crazy.</p><p><strong>10.) Placing your head below his chin:</strong> This is an obviously unintentional act but the way the woman fits in the man's body sends a sweet sensation through his body.&nbsp; The way you fit with your lover is just special and definitely so sexy.</p><p><strong>11.) When you get a little mad:</strong> You're sexy when you smile, when you open yourself up, and when you simply exist as yourself, happy and contented with the #skin you're in. But it's also good to know that I can get angry some times. I'm not necessarily slightly angry all the time or anything, but my face makes it #look like I am. Fighting with him sometimes, makes him want that make up sex even more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7kGlkrqaZo8GmutOipqeZnGLApsTYZquhoZ6cwG7Dzqacp2WUpHq1u4ytrKumXaKyr3nOp2Soql2otq%2Bzy56qZpmemXqurdGroJ6cX2awqMbJbag%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
