Would you say that you are quarrelsome or just very bold?"</p><p>She laughed before responding, "I'm just very bold; it's not me being quarrelsome, I'm just bold. I would say that I'm really firm or I have a firm personality so I'm not quarrelsome."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"How do you think that fared for you in the house?" asked the host. "It didn't go well; that's why I'm out," she retorted.</p><p>Dami was also asked, "Was it a strategy or was it just you being you?" to which she responded, "Before I went into the house, I already said that I was hotheaded and that I'm a crazy person. So if the outside world didn't see that I was being natural, then it is what it is."</p><p>When asked if she felt that she was misunderstood by the housemates, Dami affirmed and clarified that they never got to see her sweet and selfless side.</p><p>She said, "Very much so. Again, I am a firm person, so as much as it seemed to be that I am firm, bold or quarrelsome, as some people would say, I'm also a very sweet person."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"When you get close to me, you know that because I just want things to work out fine for everybody. I'm selfless and I just wanted to connect with people and some people were just being unnecessarily mean, but then it is what it is," she explained.</p><p>See the full interview below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGabmp6Wtqut0mabmqWZYrynedOapKJllKq8br%2FAsqpmq5iaerit0makoqulo7GmvtKtpqicXZ67bsDHnmShp6WosnDFkK%2BprZ%2Bb</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
