There was significant overlap between the three.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Curiously, several of the quotations have a very different meaning in context from the way they are often deployed popularly. The “greatness” that Twelfth Night‘s Malvolio contemplates in the prank letter he reads refers primarily to social status, not courage or success. Likewise, Helena’s comment that “Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind” is in direct contradiction to her circumstances, in which Demetrius has left her for the better-looking Hermia.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The quotations are almost evenly split between comedies and tragedies, though several famous passages weren’t chosen by the highlighters: Nowhere was Shylock’s “If you prick us do we not bleed?” from Merchant of Venice or Juliet’s eulogy to Romeo, made especially famous by <a href=# rel=noopener>Robert F. Kennedy’s tribute</a> to his slain brother at the 1964 Democratic convention: “Take him and cut him out in little stars, / And he will make the face of heaven so fine / That all the world will be in love with night / And pay no worship to the garish sun.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here are the 15 most highlighted Shakespeare quotes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>1. Hamlet contemplating suicide in his famous soliloquy. (Hamlet)<br></strong>“To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br>Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br>And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep;”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>2. Polonius, giving Laertes a pep talk. (Hamlet)<br></strong>“This above all: to thine own self be true,<br>And it must follow, as the night the day,<br>Thou canst not then be false to any man.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>3. Macbeth, upon learning of the queen’s death. (Macbeth)</strong><br>“Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player<br>That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br>And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>Signifying nothing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>4. Lafeu, consoling the Countess on the death of her husband and departure of her son. (All’s Well That Ends Well)</strong><br>“Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>5. The Countess dispensing some motherly wisdom to Bertram before he departs for France. (All’s Well That Ends Well)</strong><br>“Love all, trust a few,<br>Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy<br>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend<br>Under thy own life’s key: be cheque’d for silence,<br>But never tax’d for speech.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>6. Hamlet explaining to Horatio the appearance of a ghost. (Hamlet)<br></strong>“There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>7. Caesar, to his wife, brushing aside her fear that he will soon die, which he does. (Julius Caesar)</strong><br>“Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>8. Cassius, priming Brutus to join the conspiracy against Caesar. (Julius Caesar)</strong><br>“Men at some time are masters of their fates:<br>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>9. King Claudius, admitting to himself that his prayers are not heartfelt. (Hamlet)</strong><br>“My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:<br>Words without thoughts never to heaven go.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>10. Friar Lawrence, chastising Romeo for abandoning Rosaline for his new love, Juliet Capulet (Romeo and Juliet)</strong><br>“Young men’s love then lies<br>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>11. Hermia, getting in a dig at men’s infidelity (A Midsummer Night’s Dream)</strong><br>“By all the vows that ever men have broke,<br>In number more than ever women spoke”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>12. Lysander, arguing with Hermia about love (A Midsummer Night’s Dream)<br></strong>“Ay me, for aught that I could ever read,<br>Could ever hear by tale or history,<br>The course of true love never did run smooth,<br>But either it was different in blood—”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>13. Malvolio (reading from a letter by Maria, which he believes to be from Olivia) (Twelfth Night)</strong><br>“…be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon ’em.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>14. Helena, lamenting that Demetrius has left her for Hermia (A Midsummer Night’s Dream)</strong><br>“Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,<br>And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>15. Prospero reflects on the fleeting nature of drama and life (The Tempest)</strong><br>“We are such stuff<br>As dreams are made on, and our little life<br>Is rounded with a sleep.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtamluf3KFjrCgpaSZlrpuv8eaop6roJqus7GMqaOasaNivra7056qZqOZo7GtsY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
