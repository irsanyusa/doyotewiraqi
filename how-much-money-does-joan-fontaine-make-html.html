Fontaine appeared in more than 45 feature films in a career that spanned five decades. She was the younger sister of actress Olivia de Havilland.</p><p>Born in Tokyo to British parents, Fontaine moved to California before she was two years old. She traveled there along with her mother, Lilian Fontaine, and sister, the actress Olivia de Havilland, following her parents' divorce. She was anaemic as a child, and her childhood was consequently marred by poor health, but she had improved by her teen years.</p><p>Her career prospects improved greatly after her starring role in the Alfred Hitchcock-directed Rebecca (1940), for which she received the first of what would be three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress; the following year, she won for her role in Suspicion (1941). A third Oscar nomination came with the film The Constant Nymph.</p><p>For most of her middle to later life, Fontaine was active in radio, television, and the stage. She released an autobiography, No Bed of Roses, in 1978; she continued to act until her last performance in 1994. Fontaine lived in Carmel Highlands, California, where she owned a home, Villa Fontana. She died there of natural causes at the age of 96 in 2013.</p><p>Married four times, she had one child by birth and one child by adoption, from whom she was later estranged. Her relationship with her sister was long known to be acrimonious, and included long periods of estrangement, especially in later life.</p>Net Worth:<h3>Joan Fontaine Net Worth: $<span id=Total>100 Million</span></h3><b>Joan Fontaine's Income / Salary:</b><br><b>Per Year:</b> $<span id=Year>20 Million</span><p><b>Per Month:</b> $<span id=Month>2 Million</span></p><p><b>Per Week:</b> $<span id=Week>500,000</span></p><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><td><b>Per Day:</b></td><td><b>Per Hour:</b></td><td><b>Per Minute:</b></td><td><b>Per Second:</b></td></tr><tr><td>$<span id=Day>70,000</span><span></span></td><td>$<span id=Hour>3,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Minute>50</span></td><td>$<span id=Second>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Since you arrived on this page at <span id=CurrentTime></span>, Joan Fontaine Earned: <span id=earnNow></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmwp6KptW%2B6xK1ma2hhbXxxhI6hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZvKa%2FjKOmmqZdm7yvwMCipZ5lnZa4pnrHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
