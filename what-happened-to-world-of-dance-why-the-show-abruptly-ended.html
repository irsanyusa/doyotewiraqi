Season Four of the show, which concluded in August 2020, experienced lower viewership compared to previous seasons.</p><p>According to TV Series Finale, the average viewership for Season Four was around four million viewers. It represents an eight percent increase from Season Three. However, the show had lost nearly half of its viewers since its debut season, which averaged 7.7 million viewers.</p><p>Moreover, the decline in viewership was particularly significant among the key demographic of viewers aged 18 to 49. Advertisers place great importance on this demographic, and the show’s ratings in this category had decreased significantly over time.</p><p>While the first season achieved a rating of 1.83 in the coveted 18 to 49 demographic, Season Four saw a drop to 0.74. With a substantial budget, including a $1 million prize, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Dance</a> required a larger audience to sustain its production costs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>World of Dance Faced Problems During The Pandemic</h2><p>Unfortunately, the show also faced challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fourth season had to adjust to the constraints imposed by the pandemic, filming its finale without a live audience. This absence of cheering spectators and the energetic atmosphere they bring had an impact on the overall experience.</p><p>Executive producer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Lopez</a> mentioned in an interview with Variety that the absence of an audience made it tough to create the desired energy for the dancers who had worked hard to reach the finals. ] While the pandemic affected numerous unscripted competition shows, World of Dance was not alone in facing these challenges.</p><p>Plans were initially in place for So You Think You Can Dance to return in the summer of 2021, the show returned for season 17 in the summer of 2022. Meanwhile, there have been dance shows that managed to adapt and return to screens, albeit with some modifications. Dancing with the Stars resumed in the fall of 2020, and the spin-off series The Masked Dancer also made its debut at the end of the year.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_KellyClarkson_Trae-PattonNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="Kelly Clarkson Holds Nothing Back On Her Latest Single Inspired By Her Divorce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGYrWWYlr2xsc2em2asn2LEsL7LnWSonl2Zrq%2BvxGauobFdqbWmedKhprBlkZe%2FtrzTpbBmnZ6ZsqV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
