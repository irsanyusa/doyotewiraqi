Since then, the woman can’t even look at&nbsp;her ex-beloved without feeling nauseated. Here are the details of&nbsp;this story with a&nbsp;very dramatic twist.</p><p><h2>The relationship was just amazing from the start.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/765/48d/6277e9591caf9c3aaf0412a464.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman named Hailey, 38, wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and shared the emotional story of&nbsp;her struggle and disappointment.</p><p>Hailey opened her letter, saying, «I&nbsp;am divorced, and&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;daughter, Bailey, who’s 15&nbsp;years old. I&nbsp;became her mother, though she’s not my&nbsp;biological kid. My&nbsp;ex-husband had her with a&nbsp;woman whom he&nbsp;barely knew, and she was 2&nbsp;when we&nbsp;married. I&nbsp;consider Bailey my&nbsp;beloved daughter in&nbsp;every way. My&nbsp;ex-husband died sadly when she was only 5&nbsp;years old.»</p><p>Hailey goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «So&nbsp;I&nbsp;have been with my&nbsp;fiancé Tom for 5&nbsp;years. Bailey considers Tom her father. Tom, in&nbsp;his turn, has never treated the girl wrong, at&nbsp;least there were no&nbsp;moments when&nbsp;I noticed any weird or&nbsp;inappropriate behavior from him.<br>Tom was aware of&nbsp;my&nbsp;ex-husband who died, and he&nbsp;of&nbsp;course knew that Bailey isn’t my&nbsp;bio daughter. I’m now 2&nbsp;months pregnant, and we&nbsp;were engaged with Tom. The whole family was excited about having a&nbsp;new member soon, and everything seemed just right, or&nbsp;so&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought.»</p><p><h2>Bailey was treated very well by&nbsp;every member of&nbsp;the family, including her mom’s future husband.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/51c/44e/467dba52d68ed0fd30c170793a.jpg><p>Hailey wrote, «Tom has told me&nbsp;many times how he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;adopt Bailey after we&nbsp;tie the knot. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;surprise her. We&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;get married in&nbsp;2&nbsp;months, and&nbsp;I was happy that Tom was so&nbsp;serious about Bailey, this was important both for her and for&nbsp;me.<br>Her <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with Tom has always been more than friendly, the girl, in&nbsp;fact, has always thought Tom is&nbsp;her soulmate, she even shared some secrets with him and applied to&nbsp;him for help and advice with her issues. When she was teased at&nbsp;school, Tom was the person who reacted immediately, and he&nbsp;was the person who knew about it&nbsp;first. I&nbsp;personally thought that he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great dad, both for Bailey and for our baby. I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;happy!»</p><p>The woman added that Tom never raised his voice on&nbsp;Bailey and has never even acted aggressively towards her, even though she sometimes demonstrated a&nbsp;very provoking behavior. The man had always been an&nbsp;embodiment of&nbsp;calmness, and he&nbsp;solved all conflicts in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very diplomatic manner.</p><p><h2>Everything changed before the wedding.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/952/93e/e0f74d58de80308bdb6e9520b5.jpg><p>Hailey wrote, «We&nbsp;were preparing for our wedding, and though we&nbsp;didn’t plan on&nbsp;anything big, I&nbsp;still wanted this to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;special day for everyone, including my&nbsp;daughter. One evening, Tom and&nbsp;I were meeting with our friends, and this was just before the planned wedding. Bailey wasn’t with&nbsp;us at&nbsp;that moment, she was staying with her friend in&nbsp;her place. We&nbsp;were all having a&nbsp;great night.<br>Happiness was all around, and&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;very high spirits. Then the topic of&nbsp;the wedding came&nbsp;up. And things immediately went down hill. We&nbsp;started talking about our honeymoon and&nbsp;I suggested that we&nbsp;bring Bailey with&nbsp;us. I&nbsp;thought Tom would never object, and&nbsp;I was expecting a&nbsp;very positive reaction from him, I&nbsp;really wanted to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;our plan and a&nbsp;surprise for Bailey.»</p><p>Then, the things took a&nbsp;very unhealthy turn. Hailey wrote, «All of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, Tom’s face went red, and he&nbsp;said with disgust that he&nbsp;would never consider bringing „that annoying teen“ on&nbsp;our honeymoon. I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;shocked that&nbsp;I asked him to&nbsp;explain what he&nbsp;meant, I&nbsp;thought we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;misunderstanding. But Tom repeated that he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;bring Bailey.»</p><p><h2>Tom suddenly turned into a&nbsp;totally different person.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1bf/6fd/10cdad5fd9a08500c8242e79b4.jpg><p>Hailey explained, «Tom started explaining that we&nbsp;both were going to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;„real“ child, and we&nbsp;didn’t need to&nbsp;pretend anymore to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;my&nbsp;„stepdaughter“ who has never been my&nbsp;real child. This hurt so&nbsp;much. I&nbsp;just looked at&nbsp;him, like he&nbsp;was going crazy. Tom kept going on&nbsp;and&nbsp;on.»</p><p>Hailey revealed, «I&nbsp;just couldn’t believe my&nbsp;ears and eyes. I&nbsp;saw Tom finally showing his true self, and&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;vomit at&nbsp;the sound of&nbsp;his voice. I&nbsp;had so&nbsp;much trust in&nbsp;this man, I&nbsp;believed that everything he&nbsp;was doing for Bailey was sincere, and&nbsp;I thought that he&nbsp;loved me&nbsp;and loved her.<br>It&nbsp;turned out, Tom was pretending until things were getting „inconvenient“ for him, and he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;speak&nbsp;up. The most disgusting thing was that he&nbsp;sincerely believed that&nbsp;I would share his opinion on&nbsp;Bailey and that&nbsp;I would agree to&nbsp;betray her, because „I&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;real child.“»</p><p>Hailey wrote that after what had been said by&nbsp;Tom that evening, she canceled their wedding and asked Tom to&nbsp;move out. Bailey saw him packing his things, and she was crying, because she knew Tom betrayed her. Hailey was hesitating a&nbsp;lot before telling her daughter all the truth, but finally, the woman decided that Bailey deserved to&nbsp;know what kind of&nbsp;person Tom appeared to&nbsp;be. Hailey said that she didn’t want to&nbsp;break her daughter’s heart, but, at&nbsp;the same time, she didn’t want her daughter to&nbsp;have illusions about Tom’s <a href=# title=personality data-link=tag>personality</a>.</p><p>The woman closed her letter, saying that she doesn’t have any doubts that she did everything right, and she asked our readers to&nbsp;share their opinions about the choice she made.</p><p>And here’s yet another story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, whose husband deeply humiliated her right on&nbsp;their wedding day. And here’s how <a href=#>karma fired back</a> at&nbsp;him, much to&nbsp;his wife’s satisfaction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecWimKeblWK1or%2BMrJ%2Bor55itaq%2FjK2prp1dmLytu9GsZKuhl53Bbq7En6arnV2kwrN51p6bnaGenHqlrdhmoKZllJ7AqMHSrZydZWhmhXWFkmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
