The content creator has conquered the world of TikTok, YouTube and now, the adult site OnlyFans. But she got her start on ‘AGT’ in an audition that went viral.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-agt-contestant-trisha-paytas-went-from-reality-tv-star-to-onlyfans-star>‘AGT’ Contestant Trisha Paytas Went From Reality TV Star To OnlyFans Star</h2><p>How can we forget when Trisha auditioned for ‘AGT’ in 2012? The blonde bombshell wore a pink latex dress that had judge Howard Stern falling in love. Her attempts at rapping failed but she left Howard with major heart eyes. Her audition now has over 12 million views because fans of the show can’t get enough of the second-hand embarrassment. Trish got three red buzzers and was sent packing and the audition earned her even more exposure.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>WATCH TRISHA PAYTAS’ CRINGEY ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’ AUDITION THAT HAD HOWARD STERN IN LOVE</a></strong></p><p>The YouTuber has amassed nearly 5 million subscribers with her music videos, rants and mukbangs that she posts. She has also appeared on several reality shows like&nbsp;My Strange Addiction, The Millionaire Matchmaker and Celebrity Big Brother.&nbsp;On Celebrity Big Brother, Trisha opened up about her past <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">making money as an escort</a> and a stripper. She even claims to have made over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$50,000 during a night</a> with an NBA player. Some may even remember her appearance on The Ellen Show to show off her super-fast reading talent. She has put out her own original music and even embarked on her own tour.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Trisha is also a favorite creator amongst TikTok users. Some can’t decide if they love her or want to cancel her, but regardless, she gets tons of views. Her account has over 4 million followers and her videos exposing people like Jeffree Star and Shane Dawson have gone viral.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/defnoodles/status/1351329677785219073</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trisha-makes-a-fortune-posting-explicit-content-on-adult-site>Trisha Makes A Fortune Posting Explicit Content On Adult Site</h3><p>Trisha has done her fair share of reality television shows and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said some controversial things </a>in the past. But recently, one of her biggest moneymakers has been posting content on OnlyFans. She came on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryland Adams’s podcast called The Sip</a> and spoke about how the most she has ever earned in a month from OnlyFans is $1 million. To achieve such success on the platform, Trisha did collabs with both men and women. Recently, Trisha has been making more explicit solo videos that she promotes on her Twitter account.</p><p>Trisha charges $4.99 per month to access her OnlyFans content. She is reportedly one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">top 1% creators</a> on the OnlyFans platform. Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated net worth</a> in 2020 was over $4 million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B2DBWwhD6AT/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FORMER ‘X FACTOR’ CONTESTANT MAKES NEARLY $1M PER MONTH ON ADULT SITE ONLYFANS</a></strong></p><p>Trisha also spoke out when her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">main Instagram account was deleted.</a> She posted a discount code for&nbsp;Adam & Eve, a retailer that sells sex-related items before her account was disabled for 30 days. Her account was then completely deleted. Trisha believes that advertising her OnlyFans account and sexual content breached Instagram’s new Terms Of Use agreement. She is working on getting her main account back and has been using a backup account in the meantime.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Esther-Cole-The-Voice-UK-Yana-Bing-Tom-Jones.jpeg alt="Meet Esther Cole, The ‘Voice UK’ Singer With An Unforgettable Blind Audition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>agt</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuZqyinsCprYypmLKskah6uLHNrWSfqp%2BierOtz6mgp59dpLturcatZK2nXaKurLXNoGSmoZyhtrC60mamp2Wfo7m6ssCnqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
