 I served in a state in the southeast region, I have to keep some details anonymous to protect all those involved."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The exeat was to go for my call to bar, but I decided to stay for some days because I was enjoying it. I had a pass that exempted me from engaging in camp activities for health reasons, so I sat with the Red Cross group.</p><p>I met a good friend during camp who was also a lawyer like me and had a similar health challenge. We would both sit with the Red Cross group and make fun of everyone else.</p><p>I became friends with a lady who was engaged, but I had a crush on someone else which I didn't pursue. I was still battling insecurities then and I was so afraid of being rejected, so I didn’t push it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>How was life after camp?</h3></p><p>Well, I rented an apartment and started working in the Ministry of Justice. It was then my boss’ daughter tried to seduce me.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>Ehn? How?</h3></p><p>One day she came to her father’s office wearing a dress that revealed a lot of cleavage, she kept biting her lips and flipping her hair.</p><p>On my last week there, her mother asked me to go to their house to help them out with something. I got there, saw that there was no light, and took a keg to go get fuel out of the goodness of my heart. Before I got back she was in a towel looking at me with seductive eyes. I ran away. Although I found her very attractive, I respected my boss too much to act on my attraction.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>After my departure, she admitted she was trying to seduce me, confirming that my initial instincts were accurate.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>Did you experience any culture shocks?</h3></p><p>Yes, it was shocking to me that Igbo children greet their parents like their mates, and it's normal, and it's possible to over-greet someone, like you are doing too much. Meanwhile, where I am from, Yorubas can spend five minutes just greeting.</p><p>It was also shocking that most young ladies were already betrothed, and you can’t convince them to date you.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-19>Did you enjoy your NYSC experience?</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Yes, I did. My boss liked me so much that he extended my stay for months. I also got recommendations from judges for my hard work.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-21>Do you think the NYSC scheme should continue?</h3></p><p>There's no real purpose to it. It is just another chance for the Nigerian government to endanger the lives of the youth in a bid to keep its already overflowing labour market from throwing a tantrum.</p><p>I mean, when you have a very large number of unemployed youths, and you add new ones each year, you can imagine what it'll look like. The one year of NYSC is just like a half-time break for the government, which they use to do nothing and improve nothing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLq6ec2yqpxlo6m8s8WMprBmmp%2BowG6wwK6eoayVp3q1vsiem2asn2LAprDUnJxmpZVkgLPAk3Cnpg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
