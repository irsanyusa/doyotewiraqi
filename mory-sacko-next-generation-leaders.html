In the two months before a nationwide lockdown shut all restaurants, the pocket-size eatery won rave reviews and earned a Michelin star. “It was as fast as it gets,” he says. “I was not expecting it at all.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/mory-sacko-next-generation-leaders-2021.jpg><p>Mory Sacko</p><p>Edgar Berg for TIME</p><p>Then, in February, Sacko was made host of <i>Cuisine Ouverte</i> (Open Kitchen), a new show on French TV where he cooks alongside a different famous chef each week, tweaking French classics like bouillabaisse with his own diverse influences. Sacko says the network was “courageous” to have picked him—6 ft. 5 in., with dreadlocks, the child of African immigrants—as host. “We expected a sh-tstorm.”</p><p>Instead the show has been a hit, drawing up to 1.6 million viewers and heralding a cultural moment. Debuting as France has been <a href=#>grappling</a> with fraught issues of <a href=#>racial identity</a>, it offers a radically updated version of one of the country’s most cherished traditions. “People are very enthusiastic,” Sacko says. “It really is a sign that there is change in France.”</p><p>For millions who might never eat at MoSuke, it has also cemented Sacko as a new kind of national icon. Some have written to him from poor neighborhoods, he says, saying his recognition has led them to dream of becoming a chef, rather than a singer or a footballer. “I find myself in this position as a role model,” he says. “That is not necessarily what I was expecting. I was cooking to cook, to have fun. But it is a great pride.”</p><p>More Must-Reads from TIME</p><p class=author-feedback-text><strong>Contact us</strong> at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">letters@time.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmacp5yhsqTAyKilaKaVrcFus8SnnKuZpJ68r3nLnpidnaKofHd8k3BrbGtforyzxYysmJyjn2K7psTTZp6eppWnrrW1zqdkpZ2RmbKzv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
