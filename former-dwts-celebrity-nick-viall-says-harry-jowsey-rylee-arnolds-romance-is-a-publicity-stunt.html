In a recent episode of his podcast, Viall Files</strong>,<strong> Viall offered his perspective on the rumored romance between 18-year-old pro dancer Rylee Arnold and her celebrity partner, 26-year-old Harry Jowsey.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-viall-is-not-buying-harry-jowsey-rylee-arnold-s-rumored-relationship>Nick Viall is Not Buying Harry Jowsey, Rylee Arnold’s Rumored Relationship</h2><p>During the podcast, Viall was asked about the reason a DWTS pro and their partner would be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">holding hands in public</a>. Without stuttering, he responded, “For votes.” He went on to explain that DWTS loves to create buzz between its contestants and their partners. This buzz creates engagement between the show and its audience. Although some may find true love on the stage, other relationships are played up.</p><p>When it comes to Arnold and Jowsey, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Viall</a> believes that their connection is more for show than genuine affection. He characterized Jowsey as a “skilled practitioner of internet stardom,” implying that he is willing to do anything for votes.</p><p>“I mean Harry…he’s dancing with Rylee, and that’s the fakest of the fake relationships, for sure,” Viall said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>He noted that Jowsey’s approach to relationships appears to be motivated by the desire for online attention rather then genuine feelings. Despite this, Viall acknowledged that Jowsey’s strategy seems to be working well for him.</p><p>Jowsey, rather than confirming or denying their dating status, chose to tease, leaving the rumors surrounding Jowsey and Arnold unresolved. He said, “Whatever’s going on behind the scenes is gonna go on behind the scenes.” Instead of confirming or denying, Jowsey is letting fans continue their speculation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-viall-also-weighed-in-on-mauricio-umansky-emma-slater-romance>Nick Viall Also Weighed in on Mauricio Umansky, Emma Slater Romance</h2><p>Viall also weighed in on another rumored romance within DWTS Season 32, involving Mauricio Umansky and Emma Slater. The photos of the two holding hands after dinner in Beverly Hills caused quite a stir. Umansky, who is currently not together with his wife Kyle Richards, and Slater’s connection is causing some added drama behind the scenes of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a>.</p><p>In response to this, Viall expressed a different opinion, saying, “I could see that happening. I could see that being real.” He noted that Umansky’s estranged wife, Richards has been spending time with someone else, Morgan Wade, suggesting that there may be an understanding between them.</p><p>However, the plot thickened when Richards appeared on Watch What Happens Live on October 25, expressing her surprise and hurt feelings about the photos of her husband and Slater holding hands. She acknowledged the possibility of something happening between them but emphasized the uncertainty of the situation.</p><p>Despite the rumors and speculations surrounding Umansky and Slater, the two have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">maintained their stance</a> that they are not dating.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_OliviaRodrigo_LouisPartridge-220x147.jpg alt="Olivia Rodrigo is Reportedly Dating Louis Partridge — Here’s What We Know" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaippp2iYrG4wNJmmp6klZe%2FqsDYZqWim5tiw6qty6VkrJmpqHqprdGrsGain6zApsWMq7ClnZVirrO6zqWbrGWipLqiusKeZKKrXZZ6scHBpaCcoaSuerTA1KeraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
