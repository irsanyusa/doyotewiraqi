I have a friend group of 7 women from uni. I’m the only one that’s child-free, but 1 is childless, 2 are pregnant with their first, and 3 have kids.
We as a group rarely meet up. I’ve seen all of them maybe twice in the last year, and we all live in the same city."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> Internet users for their opinion whether she was right or&nbsp;wrong. Here’s her story.</p><p>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;friend group of&nbsp;7&nbsp;women from uni. I’m the only one that’s child-free, but 1&nbsp;is childless, 2&nbsp;are pregnant with their first, and 3&nbsp;have kids.</p><p>We&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;group rarely meet&nbsp;up. I’ve seen all of&nbsp;them maybe twice in&nbsp;the last year, and we&nbsp;all live in&nbsp;the same city. Every time someone asks to&nbsp;meet&nbsp;up, and we&nbsp;finally find a&nbsp;date everyone is&nbsp;available, one of&nbsp;the moms always asks if&nbsp;they can bring their child, or&nbsp;children. It’s usually 1&nbsp;of&nbsp;2&nbsp;moms, as&nbsp;the third actually wants to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;kid-free evening.</p><p>And before anyone else can answer, the other mom says yes. All 3&nbsp;moms have husbands who can watch their kids. Most of&nbsp;them also have both sets of&nbsp;grandparents who are involved. But somehow they never manage to&nbsp;find someone who can “babysit,” as&nbsp;they call&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/283/367/eedd3e5638a0eadd6eb4522c8a.jpg><p>So, at&nbsp;this point I’ve stopped answering until they’ve set a&nbsp;time and place, someone has asked about kids, and&nbsp;I say&nbsp;I can’t make&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;hang out with them one on&nbsp;one, or&nbsp;in&nbsp;smaller groups instead.</p><p>Well, a&nbsp;few days ago we&nbsp;agreed to&nbsp;finally meet&nbsp;up. No&nbsp;one had asked about kids, and we&nbsp;were having a&nbsp;barbeque and drinks night. Well, who shows up&nbsp;with their 8-year-old? Yep, one of&nbsp;the moms.</p><p>I&nbsp;clearly didn’t hide my&nbsp;annoyance and one of&nbsp;the girls asked me&nbsp;why. I&nbsp;just waved it&nbsp;off and 30&nbsp;minutes later&nbsp;I excused myself and left. I&nbsp;said&nbsp;I didn’t feel well. In&nbsp;those 30&nbsp;minutes, we&nbsp;hadn’t had any “adult talk,” we&nbsp;were just entertaining the kid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae4/9bf/dc4db958bebd98a6c479414326.jpg><p>After I&nbsp;left, I&nbsp;think they realized this was a&nbsp;pattern, and&nbsp;I got a&nbsp;text from most of&nbsp;the girls in&nbsp;the group. Some calling me&nbsp;a&nbsp;jerk, others just saying they were annoyed with me&nbsp;for leaving, while the third mom having my&nbsp;back, and asked to&nbsp;meet up&nbsp;later that week to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;proper night with drinks.</p><p>I&nbsp;don’t hate kids at&nbsp;all. I&nbsp;work with them every day and don’t want to&nbsp;spend my&nbsp;time off, relaxing with friends, having to&nbsp;entertain other people’s kids again. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;in&nbsp;the wrong here?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/76c/799/e924bc51eb9601f7925c344a62.jpg><p>Here are some Internet users’ comments:</p><ul><li>Majority rules; and you seem to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only person in&nbsp;this friend group who is&nbsp;directly opposed to&nbsp;having kids around. Nothing wrong with that, but there’s nothing wrong with the fact that your friends are in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different place in&nbsp;life than you. Also, it&nbsp;doesn’t seem like you’ve really advocated that you want “adults-only” hangouts, you just sulk in&nbsp;the background.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;GroundbreakingTwo201&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>You need to&nbsp;tell them, “I&nbsp;am not available for kid play dates but am&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;spend adult time with you guys.” You aren’t demanding they not get together without the kids, you just don’t go.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;No-Locksmith-8590&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>It&nbsp;sounds like your friend circle is&nbsp;naturally fracturing, it’s not necessarily a&nbsp;bad thing. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;quite natural for young parents to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;socialize with their children in&nbsp;tow when their friendship circle consists of&nbsp;other parents in&nbsp;the same situation. It’s also a&nbsp;nice way for their children to&nbsp;mix with others.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Haunting_Being&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>You’re being passive-aggressive. I&nbsp;understand not wanting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around kids in&nbsp;your free time, but you need to&nbsp;establish early on&nbsp;in&nbsp;the planning process that it’s just a&nbsp;gals’ night, or&nbsp;something to&nbsp;that effect. You can’t assume the others will automatically think of&nbsp;or&nbsp;want to&nbsp;arrange childcare when one of&nbsp;you suggests hanging out, and then get mad when they don’t.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;champagneformyrealfr&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;feel like it’s disrespectful to&nbsp;unilaterally decide to&nbsp;change an&nbsp;event for a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;people though. I&nbsp;love children, but they do&nbsp;completely change the vibe for the evening. I&nbsp;also feel like parents forget that their children are additional people and not just an&nbsp;extension of&nbsp;themselves. There’s nothing wrong with asking if&nbsp;the child can come, but parents need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;prepared to&nbsp;sit it&nbsp;out if&nbsp;that answer&nbsp;is, “No.” Prioritize your children, absolutely, but don’t expect the whole world&nbsp;to.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;klutsykitten&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>It’s not easy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom, and <a href=#>it’s not easy to&nbsp;deal</a> with some other moms either.
