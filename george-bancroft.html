After his education in Europe, he returned to the United States and ventured into education and politics.</p><p>He was instrumental in establishing the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis while serving as Secretary of the Navy under President <a href=#>James K. Polk</a>. Bancroft's career in public service also saw him as the U.S. Minister to the United Kingdom, the Prussian Court, and the German Empire. In these diplomatic roles, he was involved in significant negotiations and helped to solidify the international standing of the United States.</p><p>As a historian, Bancroft's work was characterized by a romantic nationalism, with a strong belief in the inevitability of American progress and expansion. His perspective was shaped by the belief in a divine Providence guiding the United States to greatness.</p><p>Though his historical approach has fallen out of favor with contemporary scholars who prefer more objective methodologies, Bancroft's influence on American historiography is undeniable. He was one of the first to attempt a grand, comprehensive treatment of American history, and his work has served as a foundation for generations of historians who followed.</p><p>Upon his death, George Bancroft was celebrated as the "father of American History," a title acknowledging his pioneering role in establishing an American narrative for the young nation's past. His contributions were also commemorated by the naming of the Bancroft Hall at the United States Naval Academy in his honor.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>October 3</a>, <a href=#>1800</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Worcester, Massachusetts, USA<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Libra</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>January 17</a>, <a href=#>1891</a> (aged 90)<br></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1852-02-21</a> George Bancroft becomes the American Geographical Society's first president</li></ul><h2>Personal Life</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1827-03-01</a> Father of U.S. History George Bancroft (26) weds first wife Sarah Dwight</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Americans</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJws8SoqaCdXZeur6%2FRqJ2t</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
