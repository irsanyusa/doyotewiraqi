Because giving birth, most often, isn’t as&nbsp;pretty as&nbsp;Hollywood seems to&nbsp;think it&nbsp;is.</p><p><h2>1. Beyoncé&nbsp;— Rumi and Sir</h2></p><p>After a&nbsp;year in&nbsp;the delivery room, the singer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> how difficult the birth of&nbsp;twins Rumi and Sir was. Beyoncé spent more than a&nbsp;month in&nbsp;bed on&nbsp;total bed rest because she was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, she weighed 215&nbsp;pounds, and her health got so&nbsp;bad that the lives of&nbsp;the three of&nbsp;them were in&nbsp;danger. They had no&nbsp;choice but to&nbsp;perform an&nbsp;emergency cesarean section. The babies then spent weeks in&nbsp;intensive care.</p><p>Safely at&nbsp;home, Beyoncé struggled with the change her body had undergone. She said she felt completely different. Of&nbsp;course, she had undergone major surgery, and her organs were temporarily displaced, and sometimes they had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;removed during the procedure. She needed time to&nbsp;heal, both physically and mentally. In&nbsp;the end, she accepted her body and said it&nbsp;was important for both men and women to&nbsp;appreciate the beauty of&nbsp;their natural figures.</p><p><h2>2. Kim Kardashian&nbsp;— North West</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d86/f32/6e470b5e70b990cd4d2a4b5b5e.jpg><p><a href=# title="Kim Kardashian" data-link=tag>Kim Kardashian</a> gave <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>birth</a> to&nbsp;her daughter North West a&nbsp;month early. The birth caught her off guard, and she had to&nbsp;rush to&nbsp;the hospital to&nbsp;bring her baby girl into the world.</p><p>Apparently, the baby had to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the incubator after birth, as&nbsp;she didn’t even weigh 4&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>3. Angelina Jolie&nbsp;— Vivienne and Knox</h2></p><p><a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a> was admitted a&nbsp;month before giving birth to&nbsp;her twins to&nbsp;be&nbsp;monitored for health complications. Although the babies were born <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earlier</a> than expected, everything was under control, and they had no&nbsp;setbacks.</p><p>Unlike Jolie, who had to&nbsp;stay a&nbsp;little longer in&nbsp;the hospital to&nbsp;check on&nbsp;her health and leave the institution in&nbsp;perfect condition and ready to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;all her children.</p><p><h2>4. Anna Faris&nbsp;— Jack</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f8/f56/fc338254d7968d0f963575f8b9.jpg><p>At&nbsp;35, Anna Faris became pregnant, and her obstetrician called it&nbsp;a&nbsp;geriatric pregnancy. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> she was amazed at&nbsp;how much energy she had for her first baby and that she was never nauseous. One day, 7&nbsp;weeks before her due date, her water broke, and she was confused and went to&nbsp;the hospital. When she got there, she was told that she could not leave until she gave birth.</p><p>After a&nbsp;week, she had to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;c-section. Little Jack was born and weighed about 3&nbsp;pounds. He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;month in&nbsp;intensive care. After that, at&nbsp;home, his first years of&nbsp;life were filled with doctor’s appointments, 4&nbsp;surgeries, physical therapy, and happiness, too, because nothing could take away little Jack’s cuteness.</p><p>The biggest struggle was in&nbsp;the guilt Faris felt. She kept wondering what she had done wrong for her baby to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through all that. But sadly, some things can’t be&nbsp;explained. Anna now belongs to&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-profit organization called the Global Alliance to&nbsp;Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth, or&nbsp;GAPPS. There, she helps raise awareness about premature babies and gives her experience as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example.</p><p><h2>5. Céline Dion&nbsp;— Eddy and Nelson</h2></p><p>Céline Dion <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had struggled</a> for some time to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother. She had had a&nbsp;miscarriage and tried in&nbsp;vitro fertilization while trying to&nbsp;get pregnant. She managed to&nbsp;have twins, but the babies did not make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;term, as&nbsp;they were born prematurely.</p><p>Fortunately, this was not a&nbsp;problem because they were completely healthy. They were slightly underweight, one at&nbsp;5.6 pounds and the other at&nbsp;5.2&nbsp;pounds, so&nbsp;they spent some time in&nbsp;the incubator.</p><p><h2>6. Adriana Lima&nbsp;— Valentina</h2></p><p>At&nbsp;only 34&nbsp;weeks pregnant, model Adriana Lima had to&nbsp;give birth to&nbsp;her first daughter. Her pregnancy was complicated, and she was diagnosed with preeclampsia. Valentina weighed 4&nbsp;pounds and had to&nbsp;stay several weeks in&nbsp;intensive care.</p><p>Lima <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that she would have liked to&nbsp;have her at&nbsp;home and take care of&nbsp;her in&nbsp;the best possible way, but due to&nbsp;the circumstances, it&nbsp;was not possible.</p><p><h2>7. Julia Roberts&nbsp;— Phinnaeus and Hazel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a64/d0f/9fb769551496d77dde2710a6ff.jpg><p>Before having their twins, <a href=# title="Julia Roberts" data-link=tag>Julia Roberts</a> and her husband, Danny Moder, desperately wanted to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bring</a> a&nbsp;child into the world. They had many complications, but that didn’t stop them from trying. Then, when Julia was pregnant, everything was going relatively well until she started feeling contractions 10&nbsp;weeks early.</p><p>Then, she had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;admitted to&nbsp;the hospital and stayed there for a&nbsp;while. The babies were born prematurely and had some complications. Phinnaeus weighed 5.5 pounds and was relatively healthy. The problem was when Hazel arrived because she was underweight, at&nbsp;4.4&nbsp;pounds, and had respiratory complications and jaundice. Roberts said that Hazel is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;sweet bread that came out of&nbsp;the oven prematurely; it&nbsp;had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back and bake a&nbsp;little longer.</p><p><h2>8. Zoe Saldaña&nbsp;— Cy&nbsp;and Bowie</h2></p><p>Zoe Saldaña also went through the anguish of&nbsp;having premature babies and spending time in&nbsp;neonatal intensive care. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> that in&nbsp;those first weeks, mothers are there at&nbsp;the mercy of&nbsp;the nurses’ good work, as&nbsp;their babies’ lives depend on&nbsp;their every move.</p><p>Later, thanks to&nbsp;that experience, Saldaña became involved with Brave Beginnings, a&nbsp;nonprofit organization that ensures hospitals have everything they need to&nbsp;help premature babies.</p><p><h2>9. Tana Ramsey&nbsp;— Jack and Holly</h2></p><p>One of&nbsp;the things that impacted Tana Ramsey the most about her babies arriving prematurely was the almost immediate separation after delivery. Jack and Holly were born 7&nbsp;weeks before their due date.</p><p>Ramsey <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> how helpless she felt after delivery, seeing the babies so&nbsp;helpless and vulnerable in&nbsp;intensive care from afar. “I&nbsp;was trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;close to&nbsp;them as&nbsp;possible, putting my&nbsp;hand on&nbsp;the incubator and holding little fingers, or&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;change diapers for my&nbsp;very tiny babies.”</p><p>What did you think when you discovered a&nbsp;new baby was coming into your family?</p><p>Angelina Jolie’s philanthropic efforts are a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;her <a href=#>heart of&nbsp;gold</a>. From adopting children and supporting refugees to&nbsp;fighting poverty and preserving nature, Jolie’s actions have made a&nbsp;significant impact on&nbsp;many lives. Her dedication to&nbsp;women’s rights, health awareness, and disaster relief further exemplifies her commitment to&nbsp;making the world a&nbsp;better place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZur8SlnJuqmam2pr%2BMsJ%2BoZZGnsm64yK%2Bgp59dpb%2Bwu8Vmq6GZpGK0qsLIp55mmpmnwal5yKylrWWRocSixdJmo6KjlWK2r3nToZxmpZ%2Brtqa%2FjHFoaW5jbnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
