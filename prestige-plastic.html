Although American Express Co. began issuing gold credit cards to affluent consumers as far back as 1966, the business is now springing to life as one of the hottest and most competitive new forms of financial service. Visa introduced a gold card in April, while MasterCard launched its version last July. The bank credit card firms are convinced that the market for prestige credit extends far beyond the 2 million cardholders who now carry the American Express gold."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Visa introduced a gold card in April, while MasterCard launched its version last July. The bank credit card firms are convinced that the market for prestige credit extends far beyond the 2 million cardholders who now carry the American Express gold.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The gilded credit cards operate much like regular ones. Consumers can use them to charge a meal, an airline ticket or a new suit. Gold-card holders also receive substantial lines of credit and benefits that include guaranteed hotel and motel reservations, automatic travel insurance and sizable cash advances.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Visa and MasterCard offer their gold cards through banks, which check the credit record of applicants and extend borrowing lines of at least $5,000. Banks market standard MasterCard and Visa cards as well. American Express gold carries a credit line of at least $2,000 and is issued jointly by the firm and participating banks. American Express green, however, is offered directly by the company.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To qualify for regular Visa or MasterCard plastic, a person needs an income of at least $10,000. The standard green American Express plastic calls for an income of about $15,000. The minimum income for the MasterCard prestige card is about $30,000, while Visa’s is about $35,000. For an American Express gold card it is approximately $20,000.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The annual fee for the gold cards is substantially more than for the regular ones. American Express charges $50 a year for its gold, compared with $35 for the standard green. MasterCard and Visa prices are set by the banks issuing them. The traditional ones are usually about $15, but the upscale ones are at least $35.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The biggest attraction for many gold carders is not more credit but prestige. Most people rarely use the extra services, although they often say that it is financially comforting to know that they are there in case of emergency. Admits a top executive for a leading New York brokerage firm: “If you want the really honest truth, I have a gold card because of the status. I almost never use the credit line. I really like to have it because it looks neat.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">MasterCard and Visa are counting heavily on that type of consumer reaction. Says Fran Schall, a Visa vice president: “This will be a status symbol for many customers. It will be very important to pull it out at a business lunch, especially when colleagues may not have the same card.” Adds MasterCard President Russell E. Hogg: “Recognition is one of the greatest marketing tools in America, and the gold card is recognized as prestige.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While American Express was first into the status credit market, Visa and MasterCard believe that the wider use of their cards will help them win customers from American Express. Each of those cards is accepted by some 3.5 million businesses, while only about 500,000 merchants take the American Express one.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">American Express, meanwhile, is trying to turn its gold card into all-purpose plastic. Last month the company introduced a fitness program that gives cardholders access to more than 100 health clubs around the world. The financial services firm is also using Shearson Loeb Rhoades, its Wall Street subsidiary, to promote the gold cards. Shearson-American Express is now launching a financial management account that combines stock and bond trading, banking and credit card transactions. The price of that service is $100 a year, which is automatically charged to the credit card account. ∎</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vbnFjaoBwvNGeqq2hl5p6sbjArKuim18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
