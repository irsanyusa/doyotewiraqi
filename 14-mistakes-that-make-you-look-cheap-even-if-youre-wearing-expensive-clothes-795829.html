However, the coolness of&nbsp;any given look doesn’t always depend on&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;money people spend. If&nbsp;you recognize yourself in&nbsp;this situation, don’t get upset. Stylists have created a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;tips that can help you look stunning and never cheap.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> collected some popular advice that will prevent your image from looking cheap. So&nbsp;here’s a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;what you should be&nbsp;more careful with when putting looks together.</p><p><h2>1. Trendy things from previous seasons</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/02a/459/e258475862ae0f835ab43a352f.jpg><p>The problem with these kinds of&nbsp;clothes is&nbsp;that other people will know how many years ago you bought them.</p><p>Wearing up-to-date, <a href=# title=trendy data-link=tag>trendy</a> clothes can be&nbsp;quite risky and costly. If&nbsp;you’re not ready to&nbsp;say goodbye to&nbsp;a&nbsp;thing from a&nbsp;season ago or&nbsp;more, fill your basic wardrobe with clothes that <a href=#>won’t lose their relevance</a> over time.</p><p><h2>2. Oversized clothing</h2></p><p>Even a&nbsp;neutral item like a&nbsp;white shirt that is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;suit everyone can look ugly if&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn’t fit you correctly. Oversized clothes that are loose on&nbsp;the body have been staying on&nbsp;trend for a&nbsp;long time now. However, outside Instagram, such things look baggy and as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were handed down from an&nbsp;older brother or&nbsp;a&nbsp;husband.</p><p>Perhaps oversized clothes look stylish on&nbsp;models with a&nbsp;more relaxed look who wear bright makeup, <a href=# title=accessories data-link=tag>accessories</a>, and high heels. But the lady carrying a&nbsp;baby, an&nbsp;umbrella, and heavy bags on&nbsp;her arms will look as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she borrowed this oversized item from her friend who weighs 30&nbsp;pounds more than she does.</p><p>Interestingly, stylists often recommend tailoring clothes or&nbsp;<a href=#>customizing their size</a> rather than choosing baggy outfits that are a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;sizes too big.</p><p><h2>3. Colorful rivets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fbd/3bf/da6db4599087796e323a050969.jpg><p>You should never be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry while shopping for new jeans. After trying them on&nbsp;and checking the seams, make sure to&nbsp;check all the rivets and zippers. Colorful rivets can make the jeans look unique but only until they get put into the washing machine. Even high-quality dyes will fade after being washed, making the clothes look unkempt.</p><p>Pay attention to&nbsp;signs: they should correspond to&nbsp;the jeans’ brand. This will also help to&nbsp;check the <a href=#>authenticity of&nbsp;the purchase</a>.</p><p><h2>4. Denim with inscriptions or&nbsp;ribbons</h2></p><p>Jeans with inscriptions haven’t passed over any fashion-monger, even Victoria Beckham. But style icons and their followers have successfully left this <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> trend back in&nbsp;the ’90s where it&nbsp;belongs.</p><p>Numerous inscriptions, stripes, zippers, and rivets are inversely proportional to&nbsp;the value of&nbsp;the clothing item (with rare exceptions).</p><p>Do&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;look high-class? Then opt for jeans with a&nbsp;minimalist style&nbsp;— the simpler, the better. Make sure to&nbsp;pay attention to&nbsp;the quality of&nbsp;the item. The fabric shouldn’t be&nbsp;protruding in&nbsp;the knee area or&nbsp;ridging in&nbsp;the waist area. Don’t be&nbsp;afraid that plain jeans will look too simple. You can always <a href=#>implement them with bright accessories</a> such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;belt, a&nbsp;bag, or&nbsp;some shoes.</p><p><h2>5. Bad color combinations</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66f/32f/27996a5ce4b6de0c7b4326d0aa.jpg><p>The inability to&nbsp;mix clothing correctly can make even the trendiest and expensive clothes look cheap.</p><p>Acid shades are not suitable for everyday wear. Bright clothes should be&nbsp;balanced with pastel tones&nbsp;— it’s the colors that form the basis of&nbsp;the wardrobe. It’s good if&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the colors can be&nbsp;<a href=#>neutral</a>, like black, milk, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;skin tone. On&nbsp;the other hand, many girls who are inspired by&nbsp;the idea of&nbsp;the basic wardrobe, refuse to&nbsp;wear bright colors completely. Gray, beige and black colors prevail in&nbsp;their wardrobe. If&nbsp;the combination of&nbsp;bright colors seems too bold for you, start by&nbsp;combining several things of&nbsp;<a href=#>the same color in&nbsp;one look but in&nbsp;different shades</a>.</p><p><h2>6. Low-quality seams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ede/d2c/74887653d9a639d46800b8d070.jpg><p>It’s well-known that sticky thread is&nbsp;a&nbsp;universal evil that indicates the ignoble origin of&nbsp;clothing. But even seams that look normal at&nbsp;first glance <a href=#>don’t guarantee that the item was sewn well</a>.</p><p>Pay attention to&nbsp;the areas where seams join&nbsp;— the end of&nbsp;one seam should be&nbsp;matching the beginning of&nbsp;the second seam on&nbsp;the other end perfectly. Seams of&nbsp;high-quality items are all placed well, especially in&nbsp;spots where the fabric gets stretched or&nbsp;rubbed on&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot (like in&nbsp;the photo). Otherwise, you might end up&nbsp;getting loose or&nbsp;torn seams after the first washing cycle.</p><p><h2>7. Scratches on&nbsp;glasses</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b57/80f/e9215d50f2b281bc9d3f823aa0.jpg><p>Scratched lenses on&nbsp;<a href=# title=glasses data-link=tag>glasses</a> look can look unkempt, indicating possible untidiness of&nbsp;their owner. But mostly, they just look cheap. More expensive models are less prone to&nbsp;getting scratched and moreover, are <a href=#>safe</a> for their owners to&nbsp;wear.</p><p>Glasses are one of&nbsp;the showiest accessories around. Any obvious damage on&nbsp;them will enhance the cheapness of&nbsp;the material. That’s why if&nbsp;you’re wearing glasses with non-expensive plastic lenses, make sure to&nbsp;watch their condition carefully and carry them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special case.</p><p><h2>8. T-shirts with words or&nbsp;sayings on&nbsp;them</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b59/0af/aa484e53bc929903e22f1d833a.jpg><p>Clothes with “jokes” on&nbsp;them are great for teenagers or&nbsp;for special occasions (like as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift or&nbsp;a&nbsp;costume for a&nbsp;party). But in&nbsp;everyday life, they make adults look childish and immature. T-shirts with lurid signs and prints that draw attention can also look cheap.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’re buying a&nbsp;T-shirt with an&nbsp;inscription of&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown language on&nbsp;it, make sure you know the correct translation as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;get into an&nbsp;awkward situation or&nbsp;become the butt of&nbsp;a&nbsp;joke.</p><p><h2>9. Tumbled fur on&nbsp;the hood</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06c/3d9/bdff9652aca46e81488de946d4.jpg><p>Faux fur is&nbsp;beautiful, ethical, and always relevant. Well-known world brands include this material in&nbsp;their <a href=#>collections</a>. Budget brands do&nbsp;it&nbsp;too but they often try to&nbsp;save money on&nbsp;the quality of&nbsp;this fake fur. Faux fur can actually look more beautiful than the natural kind. Pay attention to&nbsp;the quality of&nbsp;the item.</p><p>Fur should be&nbsp;removable so&nbsp;that you can wash your clothing item without it&nbsp;still attached. Otherwise, it&nbsp;might get tumbled and will look unpresentable.</p><p><h2>10. Missing buttons</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36b/887/7a407a58ec8a1fe7a148c8f914.jpg><p>Buttons are one of&nbsp;the least noticeable details on&nbsp;clothing&nbsp;— that&nbsp;is, until they go&nbsp;missing. That’s why you need to&nbsp;regularly check your clothes for the presence of&nbsp;all its little elements, including buttons that are missing or&nbsp;that are too tight. You’re unlikely to&nbsp;find any time to&nbsp;fix the button if&nbsp;you discover the issue in&nbsp;the morning right before you head out to&nbsp;work.</p><p>Don’t go&nbsp;outside with a&nbsp;missing button&nbsp;— it&nbsp;will spoil your look and make your outfit appear cheap and untidy.</p><p><h2>11. Heels or&nbsp;tips of&nbsp;your shoes that are worn out</h2></p><p>Even if&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;wait for several months to&nbsp;save some money for new shoes, don’t wear unkempt footwear.</p><p>Scratches can be&nbsp;fixed with shoe polish while transparent shine cream can “rejuvenate” shoes for several seasons at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time. Make sure to&nbsp;replace heeltaps on&nbsp;time before they get too worn-out and become noticeable to&nbsp;others. Also, remember you can always do&nbsp;a&nbsp;one-time repair.</p><p><h2>12. Polished nails without a&nbsp;manicure</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d6/67a/df7eed52d08d5cb7f2d1a09bd7.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you don’t have time for a&nbsp;hygienic manicure, don’t bother painting them a&nbsp;color because it&nbsp;will draw attention to&nbsp;your unkempt hands. Hygiene should come first, decor second.</p><p>If&nbsp;the cuticle looks messy, but the polish is&nbsp;still solid, put some oil on&nbsp;the dry skin more often. This will help to&nbsp;smooth out any irregularities. The quickest option for a&nbsp;manicure is&nbsp;to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;colorless polish. It&nbsp;will make the hands look neat even without caring for the cuticles.</p><p><h2>13. Light clothes in&nbsp;winter</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;showy mini-dress in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cold season doesn’t look stunning and cool but conversely, awkward and ridiculous. Moreover, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;dangerous for your health! If&nbsp;people turn around to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;you, it’s only because you’re wearing clothes not suitable for the season.</p><p>Even if&nbsp;your route doesn’t force you to&nbsp;brave the cold, like if&nbsp;you have underground parking or&nbsp;travel without stepping outside much, thin tights and short outfits are better to&nbsp;be&nbsp;put off until spring.</p><p><h2>14. A&nbsp;“pimped&nbsp;up” appearance</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9f/796/a945635b3499c72a77ffb877ef.jpg><p>“Pimping&nbsp;up” your appearance or&nbsp;loving yourself without fillers, cosmetic procedures, and permanent makeup is&nbsp;a&nbsp;personal choice. The main thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;unnoticeable for those around you. If&nbsp;everyone gives you compliments about looking fresh after a&nbsp;cosmetic procedure, everything is&nbsp;fine. But if&nbsp;everyone keeps noticing changes in&nbsp;your facial features, it&nbsp;means you may have overdone it&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit.</p><p><a href=#>World-class stars</a> who were once fond of&nbsp;looking plastic have started to&nbsp;refuse fillers which can definitely benefit their overall look.</p><p>What clothing elements seem inappropriate to&nbsp;you? What, in&nbsp;your opinion, makes a&nbsp;look appear cheap?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH51ecyiqq2Zm5rAbsDHmqtmpZGgsm7Fzq5kpaefoHqktMSap2adppq7brXFZrCoraKaerixwKugp59dmsWxsc2soK%2BdXZi5sMDHnqpmb2lqhXOFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
