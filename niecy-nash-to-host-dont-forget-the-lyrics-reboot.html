The series was first hosted by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayne Brady</a> between 2007 and 2009. A syndicated version was then hosted by Mark McGrath.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>NIECY NASH DISHES ON HER ‘HERSBAND’ AND HOSTING ‘THE MASKED SINGER’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-niecy-nash-to-host-don-t-forget-the-lyrics>Niecy Nash to Host ‘Don’t Forget the Lyrics!’</h2><p>The original version of the show was created by Jeff Apploff, who serves as a producer on the reboot. Apploff also produces fellow FOX game show Game of Talents, currently hosted by Brady. In addition to airing on FOX, the reboot will be available to stream on Tubi.</p><p>The premise of the show is that contestants are challenged to remember the lyrics to songs in various genres. They’ll sing part of the song with lyrics on the screen, before the lyrics disappear and they have to come up with the rest of the words on their own.</p><p>Deadline reports that the big prize is $1 million. Contestants who make it through nine songs without forgetting the lyrics will face a No. 1 hit for a chance at winning. The show’s format has been sold to 20 countries since it original run.</p><p>“I’m so excited to be part of the DFTL family,” Nash said in a statement. “I love music and I’m happy to be involved in a show that gives people an opportunity to win life-changing amounts of money.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nash-previously-guest-hosted-the-masked-singer>Nash Previously Guest Hosted ‘The Masked Singer’</h3><p>Nash recently filled in for Masked Singer host Nick Cannon for the first part of Season 5. Cannon <a href=#>tested positive for COVID-19</a>, so he had to sit out some of the episodes. Nash had previously been as a guest judge on the show, and she also appeared on Ken Jeong’s I Can See Your Voice.</p><p>Nash brought plenty of fun and energy to the show. Cannon later returned as host in the most unexpected fashion, by performing as <a href=#>one of the masked contestants</a>. He was disguised as the Bulldog, and Nash chose him to be eliminated before he unmasked himself and shocked the audience.</p><p>Are you excited to watch Nash host a new show?
