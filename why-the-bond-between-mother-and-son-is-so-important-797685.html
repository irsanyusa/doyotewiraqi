We at Bright Side believe that a mother’s love can make any boy into a magnificent human being. Here’s how:
It helps them do better in school.
Researchers have found that nurturing has a direct impact on how a child’s brain develops."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There is&nbsp;indeed an&nbsp;immense <a href=#>influence</a> a&nbsp;mother-son relationship has on&nbsp;his personality and life overall. Boys who are close with their mothers grow up&nbsp;into stable and happy people, who are so&nbsp;needed in&nbsp;our society.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side </strong>believe that a&nbsp;mother’s love can make any boy into a&nbsp;magnificent human being. Here’s how:</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;helps them do&nbsp;better in&nbsp;school.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5df/927/7160bf5a1280681b8a614d5eba.jpg><p>Researchers have <a href=#>found</a> that nurturing has a&nbsp;direct impact on&nbsp;how a&nbsp;child’s brain develops. Specifically in&nbsp;the area that’s responsible for learning, memory, and stress responses. A&nbsp;mother that is&nbsp;attentive to&nbsp;her son from the very first days, already makes a&nbsp;significant impact on&nbsp;his performance at&nbsp;school. So&nbsp;the more care she gives to&nbsp;him, the more care he’ll apply when studying.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;keeps them out of&nbsp;trouble.</h2></p><p>Another bit of&nbsp;<a href=#>research</a> shows that a&nbsp;close relationship with a&nbsp;mom significantly lowers the risk of&nbsp;boys getting involved in&nbsp;high-risk behaviors. It’s based largely on&nbsp;the mother-son attachment. Creating a&nbsp;safe environment at&nbsp;home and being an&nbsp;important person in&nbsp;a&nbsp;male child’s life makes him want to&nbsp;sustain this relationship and stay away from anything that could tamper with&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;promotes confidence.</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;mother’s support is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong force. We&nbsp;all need our personal cheerleaders in&nbsp;life, and for a&nbsp;boy having his mom as&nbsp;his #1 fan is&nbsp;a&nbsp;major confidence booster. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy feels secure around his mom, there is&nbsp;less of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>chance</a> of&nbsp;him acting up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the future. In&nbsp;addition, if&nbsp;he&nbsp;has his mom’s support, he&nbsp;will believe in&nbsp;himself and won’t be&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;try new things.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;strengthens his social skills.</h2></p><p>One <a href=#>study</a> discovered that children who spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time with their mothers are 20-40% better at&nbsp;being social. The reason for that is&nbsp;that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stronger cognitive development that happens through doing activities together. A&nbsp;boy will have better verbal skills through communication with his mom. In&nbsp;addition, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;around their parent more, they can observe them and learn proper social interactions.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;eliminates destructive male stereotypes.</h2></p><p>Several <a href=#>studies</a> have found that mothers are more accepting of&nbsp;girl’s emotions than boy’s, which can eventually lead to&nbsp;psychological withdrawal. That is&nbsp;why a&nbsp;supportive mother should encourage her boy to&nbsp;express his emotions. She should explain that crying doesn’t make him look less manly and that it&nbsp;provides comfort when needed. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the boy will grow up&nbsp;into an&nbsp;emotionally available man, who’s honest about his feelings, and doesn’t live according to&nbsp;gender stereotypes.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;promotes higher emotional intelligence.</h2></p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;male stereotypes and being able to&nbsp;express feelings in&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy way, boys with secure attachments to&nbsp;their mothers are less likely to&nbsp;<a href=#>develop</a> behavioral problems, which could interfere with their emotional development. They know how to&nbsp;deal with interpersonal conflicts, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;form connections with other people, which is&nbsp;useful in&nbsp;almost all areas of&nbsp;our life.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;softens the transition into adulthood.</h2></p><p>Growing up&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;stressful experience. Many kids are afraid to&nbsp;leave the nest and pursue independence. Interestingly, <a href=#>research</a> has shown that children who have a&nbsp;supportive household feel much more confident to&nbsp;go&nbsp;off on&nbsp;their own, because they know their parents will always be&nbsp;there for them. So&nbsp;while it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;tough for a&nbsp;momma to&nbsp;see her boy become a&nbsp;man, she can be&nbsp;confident that he&nbsp;will be&nbsp;okay, all thanks to&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;builds a&nbsp;man who respects women.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/335/704/d8910b585d832717c57f4bcefd.jpg><p>It’s basically impossible to&nbsp;imagine that a&nbsp;man who loves and cares for his mother would treat other women badly. By&nbsp;being close to&nbsp;his mom, a&nbsp;boy <a href=#>learns</a> how to&nbsp;communicate with females and learns about their <a href=# title=psyche data-link=tag>psyche</a>. If&nbsp;you’ve met men who are attentive to&nbsp;women and respect their needs, you can bet that they have a&nbsp;great relationship with their mother.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;lowers their risk for mental health issues.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f6a/190/4079995308b92fa395e15d2dca.jpg><p>Circling back to&nbsp;the mother-son attachment, it&nbsp;was also <a href=#>proven</a> that it&nbsp;significantly strengthens a&nbsp;boy’s mental health. He&nbsp;learns to&nbsp;efficiently cope with issues and receives enough support to&nbsp;steer clear of&nbsp;depression and anxiety.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;helps boys become successful.</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;<a href=#>combine</a> doing good in&nbsp;school, being confident, being mentally stable, and being sociable, we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;perfect recipe for a&nbsp;winner in&nbsp;life. And we’re not just talking about financial success, we’re talking about what’s most important: happiness. Any mother wants to&nbsp;see her boy happy, and her involvement in&nbsp;his life cannot be&nbsp;overestimated.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have men in&nbsp;your life that appreciate how much their mothers affected them?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYytn55lkqS7pXnBnquwnZWjeq6706Gcq2WRo7Fuv86nZKKrXai8brXMqaarrJGjwW6DmHBtcW1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
