Whether you’re looking to make a little extra cash selling tickets, or looking for ways to snag amazing seats for a great deal the next time your favorite band or sports team is in town, there’s a wide range of websites out there. Take into consideration things like buyer and seller fees, payment methods that are accepted, countries the website works in, and even customer service, so when you’re having any issue buying or selling, you know you’ll have support. Here’s our list of the best resale sites to buy and sell tickets.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-ticket-resale-sites>How to choose the best ticket resale sites?</h2><p>When you’re looking to buy and sell concert tickets, here are a few things to keep in mind.</p><h3>Seller commissions and buyer fees</h3><p>If you’re selling, make sure you’re getting a good percentage back. If you’re buying, you want to be sure you’re not going to get slapped with a bunch of unforeseen fees when you go to check out. It’s important to know these rates ahead of time before choosing a website to use.</p><h3>Refund policy</h3><p>All kinds of scenarios can happen, like events being canceled, can pop up and create an issue —so knowing the refund policy of the website you purchase the ticket from is helpful.</p><h3>Checkout fees</h3><p>Be aware of check-out fees before buying or selling. Knowing these checkout fees and being transparent when selling on the site can help people better plan on seats within their budget.</p><h3>Availability</h3><p>You’ll want to use a website with a large number of buyers and sellers. The bigger the audience, the better the chance you’ll sell your tickets. In addition to it being a good thing for the seller, the buyer has a bigger selection from which to choose.</p><h3>Support</h3><p>There’s nothing quite as annoying as needing support, whether you’re a buyer or a seller, and being on hold for 20 minutes. Customer service holds more value than people realize. It’s important to have reliable support when buying or selling online.</p><h2 id=our-picks-for-the-top-ticket-resale-sites>Our picks for the top ticket resale sites</h2><h3>Best for buyer volume: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Ticketmaster</a></h3><p>Ticketmaster Entertainment, LLC is one of the best-known options for buying tickets at great prices, and reselling tickets—if that’s your side hustle.
