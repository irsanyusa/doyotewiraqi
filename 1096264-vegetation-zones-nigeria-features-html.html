These zones are further subdivided into three each, for a total of six vegetation zones.</p><h2>Vegetation zones in Nigeria and their states</h2><p class=align-left>Here is a look at the different Nigerian vegetation zones and their characteristics.</p><h3>1. Sahel Savannah</h3><p class=align-left>This is a semiarid region that extends from Senegal eastward to Sudan. It forms a transitional zone between the belt of humid savannas to the south and the predominantly arid Sahara desert to the north. This zone is characterized by a short rainy season and a long, intensely dry season.</p><p class=align-left>One of the defining characteristics of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sahel Savanna</a> in Nigeria is its low precipitation. The annual rainfall in this zone is <a href=#>extremely poor</a>, with the wet season lasting three to four months.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/25fac000e160e7d0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fun facts about Antarctica for kids: interesting things to know</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/25fac000e160e7d0.jpg><p class=align-left>As a result, the vegetation of the Sahel zone is largely comprised of short, hardy grasses. Other common plants include the African myrrh, Acacia, and Ngibbi. The states of <a href=#>Borno</a> and Yobe are in this vegetation zone.</p><h3>2. Sudan Savannah</h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sudan Savannah</a> is a wide belt of tropical savanna running across Africa south of the Sahel, separated into east and west ecoregions by the Cameroon highlands.</p><p class=align-left>The zone is slightly wetter than the Sahel Savannah and receives between 500 and 1000 mm of rainfall each year. The vegetation in this region includes dense but short grass, acacia trees, and baobab trees.</p><h4>What economic activity is carried out at Sudan Savannah?</h4><p class=align-left>In Nigeria, the main economic activities in this zone include cattle and sheep rearing as well as come crop farming. The states of Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, and Kebbi are found in this zone.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fe348ce50c861492.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 most famous rivers in the world we all learned about in school</span></p></a><h3>3. Guinea Savannah</h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Guinea savannah</a> is the largest vegetation zone in Nigeria, covering almost half of the country's landmass. This zone is among the savanna zones in Nigeria, characterized by moist grasslands, with precipitation ranging between 1000 and 1400 mm per year.</p><p class=align-left>The grass in the wild areas of this zone is quite tall, often exceeding five feet. Some of the most common savannah crops in Nigeria include elephant grass, kaya, mitragyna, and isoberlinia. The states of Niger, Kaduna, Adamawa, Bauchi, and Gombe are found in the Nigerian Guinea savannah.</p><h3>4. Montane/rainforest vegetation</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dc4e959021fe041a.jpg><p class=align-left>The <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">montane vegetation</a> area in Nigeria is a region where mountainous forests are quite prevalent. This is mostly on the eastern edge of Taraba State, close to the Cameroonian border. The Jos plateau, one of the highest points in Nigeria, is located in this zone.</p><p class=align-left>Montane vegetation in <a href=#>Niger</a>ia is mostly found along the right bank of the lower reaches of the river Niger and in the valley of the River Cross. Trees in these rainforests can grow as tall as 45 meters and make up the largest parts of forest reserves in the country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/71aae34c08efc33d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rice price spike offers preview of climate food disruption</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Much of the montane region is covered by rainforests. The gently sloping areas of this region are perfect for cash crops since the area receives sufficient rainfall throughout the year. Some sections of the montane area are also utilized by commercial cattle farmers. A section of <a href=#>Taraba State</a> is in this region.</p><h3>5. Mangrove swamp forest</h3><p class=align-left>The mangrove vegetation region is an ecological belt found in the <a href=#>Nigerian areas</a> bordering the Atlantic Ocean. The vegetation in this zone largely depends on the coastal location of the region. Typically, the soil in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mangrove zone</a> is extremely poor and contains huge amounts of salt.</p><p class=align-left>Mangrove shrubs are prevalent in the salty water sections, while other plants, including human-grown rice, <a href=#>can</a> be found in the stabilized, non-saline areas.</p><h4>Which regions does the Mangrove swamp forest occupy?</h4><p class=align-left>The mangrove swamp forest region occupies much of Nigeria's southern coast. The states of Akwa-Ibom, Rivers, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Delta</a> are partly in this region.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6c963296ecbd2536.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Colombia mulls future of massive coal mine as water dries up</span></p></a><h3>6. Freshwater swamp forest</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fe348ce50c861492.jpg><p class=align-left>A freshwater swamp forest is defined as a forest that is inundated with freshwater as a permanent, irregular, or seasonal condition. These forests are mainly found on the lower parts of a river or freshwater lakes in many different regions having a wide range of climate types.</p><p class=align-left>The freshwater swamp forest is the smallest vegetation region in Nigeria. It occupies most of the Niger Delta, between the lowland rainforests in the north and the mangrove swamps in Iguwhich.</p><p class=align-left>The Niger Delta is widely considered one of the richest ecosystems in the world. The states of Edo, Lagos and Cross River are partly in this ecological region.</p><h2>How many vegetation zones are there in Nigeria?</h2><p class=align-left>There are six vegetation zones in Nigeria. The six are split from the broader savannah and forest ecological regions.</p><h2>What are the locations of the main vegetation zones in Nigeria?</h2><p class=align-left>The ecological <a href=#>zones in Nigeria</a> are as follows, from south to north: Mangrove Swamp and Coastal Vegetation, Freshwater Swamp Forest, Lowland Rain Forest, Derived Savanna, Guinea Savanna, Sudan Savanna, and Sahel Savanna.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f7d8f8baa41ca663.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Canada wildfires inflict brutal toll on tourism, other areas of economy</span></p></a><h2>What is the most major vegetation zone in Nigeria?</h2><p class=align-left>The Guinea Savannah is the largest vegetation zone in Nigeria, covering almost half of the country's landmass.</p><h2>What are the types of vegetation present in Nigeria?</h2><p class=align-left>The major vegetation of Nigeria include:</p><ul><li>Sahel Savannah</li><li>Sudan Savannah</li><li>Guinea Savannah</li><li>Montane/rainforest vegetation</li><li>Mangrove swamp forest</li><li>Freshwater swamp forest</li></ul><p class=align-left>Nigeria has six vegetation zones, each with unique definitive characteristics.
