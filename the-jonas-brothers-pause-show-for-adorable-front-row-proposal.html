It’s definitely a moment that Harris and Jenna will never forget.</p><p>Following the show, the Jonas Brothers uploaded the adorable video, showing Harris unexpectedly kneeling in front of his girlfriend, while holding the ring. Soon after this moment, the crowd went hysterical out of excitement.</p><p>“She said YES! #THETOUR,” the band wrote on Instagram.</p><p>As seen in the video, Joe was holding a camera to film the special moment. Meanwhile, Nick was comfortably sitting on stage while belting out one of their tracks.</p><p>In the comments, Jenna thanked the Jonas Brothers for helping her fiancé pull of the plan. Amazingly, she’s an avid fan of the band and has watched more than 20 of their shows live.</p><p>“Thank you SO much for facilitating this! @hikyleharris did the best job and i love that the three of you were all in on this too! It was truly overwhelming and caught me off guard but having you all apart of this means so much!” she wrote.</p><p>Harris, for his part, thanked the band for making the night “special for us.” He also mentioned and expressed gratitude for all the people behind the proposal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-admire-joe-for-staying-strong-amid-divorce>Fans Admire Joe for Staying Strong Amid Divorce</h2><p>While many fans took the time to congratulate the newly engaged couple, others pointed out Joe’s happiness. It’s no secret that Joe is currently facing personal problems regarding his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">divorce from Sophie Turner.</a> Thus, seeing him in a happy disposition is a relief to his fans.</p><p>“I love Joe so much. Even after everything he’s going through he’s the absolute biggest support of love,” one fan wrote.</p><p>“I love that Joe still celebrates love!” another person commented.</p><p>It was recently revealed that Jonas and Turner have come to an agreement regarding the kids’ custody. The musician and the Game of Thrones actress share two daughters, Delphine, 15 months, and Willa, 3.</p><p>“After a productive and successful mediation, we have agreed that the children will spend time equally in loving homes in both the US and the UK. We look forward to being great co-parents,” they said.</p><p>The agreement specifically states that the kids will be with Turner until October 21, and she’s allowed to take them to the UK during that time. Jonas will then have the kids until November 2, at which point return to Turner until November 22. They will then return to Jonas for the Thanksgiving holiday, before going back to Turner on December 16. They’ll apparently spend Christmas and New Year’s with their mom.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_AdamLevine_Manny-Carabel_Getty-Images-for-Audacy-220x147.jpg alt="Kelly Clarkson, One Republic, Maroon 5 Rock Audacy’s 10th Annual We Can Survive Concert" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>jonas brothers</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the jonas brothers</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqKfo660ecGrpq2glafAbrzArqqeZaOdvLh5xaipZpmUpL%2BirsueZJ%2Bqn6PBbr7OsGSpqp%2BlvLSty2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
