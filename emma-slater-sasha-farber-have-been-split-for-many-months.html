This split comes as no surprise to fans, since the couple has been seen without one another one multiple occasions.</strong></p><p>The fans were right on this dance couple’s relationship. On August 24, it was revealed that <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> professionals Emma Slater and Sasha Farber have officially split after four years of marriage.</p><p>“They’ve been apart for many months now,” a source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> to US Weekly. “They both have not been wearing their wedding rings and are each leading a single life.”</p><p>As part of the sources confirmation, they acknowledged that the decision was “tough” for the pair. They are still trying to figure out what life apart looks like at this time.</p><p>“It’s been a difficult time since they really care about each other and have been together for so long,” the source said before revealing that they haven’t filed for divorce yet.</p><p>This dance duo is currently working toward finding their place as things settle. Reports state that they’re going to continue working together as professional dancers, like they did following their 2014 split. The source clarified that the dancers will not “let their personal life get in the way of DWTS.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emma-slater-sasha-farber-s-relationship-timeline>Emma Slater, Sasha Farber’s Relationship Timeline</h2><p>Slater and Farber originally met in 2009 while appearing in the Broadway and West End productions of Burn The Floor. They originally began dating two years after they met in 2011. A year later, the couple joined Dancing With the Stars as part of the dance trope. In 2013, they were both given the role of professional dancers on the series.</p><p>This couple originally split and remained friends in 2014. They rekindled their love a year later, bought a house together and even got engaged on a live episode on Dancing With the Stars. On March 25, 2018, they got married in Los Angeles, California. Earlier this year, they both appeared as part of the Dancing With the Stars live tour.</p><p>This couple’s timeline has tons of fan speculation in regard to their relationship status. Even though fans recently called Slater out for taking a <a href=#>solo vacation</a>, they knew something was up when Slater posted a “friendly” birthday post for Farber. Even though the professional dancer states that Farber is loved by many, there is no “I love you” statement. There’s also no clear mention of their marriage within the caption.</p><p>Fans believe that the couple attempted to <a href=#>announce their separation</a> in January on Farber’s Instagram account. Not only is this one of their last photos together, Farber is holding a cue card that says “The End” on it.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Original_MaksandPeta_Phillip-Faraone_Getty-Images.jpg alt="Peta Murgatroyd Shares That IVF Transfer Did Not Work in Candid Post" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xKakmmWjoa61sdFmqpqrmJZ6p63Rm5yrZZiWw6Z5wZ6cp2WjpbmqwIyfpqtlnZa7unnMqKWtoKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
