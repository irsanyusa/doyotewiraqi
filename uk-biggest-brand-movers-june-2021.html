Vue and Odeon were tied at second place after having registered upticks in nine out of 13 YouGov BrandIndex metrics, while Cineworld claimed the joint-fourth spot. Notably, all three brands witnessed month-over-month growth in four metrics - Buzz, Satisfaction, Ad Awareness and WOM Exposure.</p><p>But the crown for Biggest Brand Mover this month goes to GHD amid the company’s <a href=#>20th anniversary celebrations</a>. The haircare brand, popular worldwide for its line of electrical products such as hair straighteners and curlers, registered significant upticks in ten metrics in May compared to April. The brand made a particularly spectacular jump in Impression scores, rising 4.7 points to 21.3. Its Value score also witnessed a 3.8-point spike to reach 5.6 points. Quality, Reputation, Recommend, Awareness, Ad Awareness, Current Customer, Consideration and Purchase Intent are the other metrics in which GHD made statistically significant upward movement.</p><p>Next on the list are Odeon and Vue. The multiplex brands sparkled in the Purchase funnel metrics of Consideration and Purchase Intent. Vue’s Consideration score jumped 3.5 points, while Odeon rose 2.7 points. Odeon also grew 2 points in Purchase Intent, while Vue rose by 1.6. Cineworld (ranked fourth) did particularly well in Ad Awareness and WOM Exposure, increasing 2.4 points and 2.7 points in those metrics respectively.</p><p>In the third spot is fashion brand Boohoo with statistically significant upticks in seven metrics. The brand witnessed a significant recovery in its dented Buzz score after it linked a <a href=#>£150m bonus scheme to changes in factory conditions</a>. It jumped 3.2 points to go from -6.5 to -3.3. The Burnley-based brand was also able to recover a lot of ground in its Reputation score, going from -9.9 to -6.2. What’s more, it registered a significant increase in Impression, Value, Satisfaction, Recommend and Ad Awareness.</p><p>Moving lower down the list, appliance giant LG, video game franchise Apex Legends and property dealer Hamptons take the joint fourth spot alongside Cineworld, with gains in six YouGov BrandIndex metrics each.</p><p>South Korean electronics behemoth LG was in the news in early April for the slightly unflattering news about their decision to <a href=#>shut down its loss-making cell phone business</a>. But that did nothing to dampen consumer perception about the brand. On the back of the launch of the LG G1 TV, which has <a href=#>received rave reviews</a>, the brand registered upticks in Buzz, Impression, Quality, Value, Recommend and Purchase Intent. It surged ahead in the Quality metric by 6.8 points and gained a 3.7-point boost in its Recommend score too.</p><p>Apex Legends witnessed growth in Quality, Value, Satisfaction, Recommend, Consideration and WOM Exposure. The upticks may have had something to do with the <a href=#>announcement of a mobile version</a> of the game. The brand also <a href=#>teased a new mode</a> of the game, called Arenas, in April.</p><p>Property agent Hamptons also gained in six metrics but made the most dramatic rise in Awareness scores. The brand jumped 7.4 points to reach a score of 22.9.</p><p>Registering spikes in five metrics apiece, Freesat – a television platform – and Pandora – the jewellery maker – closed out the Brand Movers list for June. Pandora’s upticks came amid the <a href=#>news that the brand’s outlets will stop selling mined diamonds</a> in favour of lab-grown ones due to ethical concerns associated with mining.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Discover how the nation feels about your brand.
