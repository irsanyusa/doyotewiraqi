Brown. The "This is Us Original Score" soundtrack was released earlier this year and debuted on the iTunes Top Soundtrack Chart. Khosla composed the hit song, "We Can Always Come Back To This," which ranked #12 on iTunes Top 100 songs and #1 in the Billboard Blues Charts for four consecutive weeks. The song earned Khosla an award nomination from the Guild of Music Supervisors for Best Song/Recording for Television. Following the show's season two finale, the "This is Us (Music from the Series) Season 2" soundtrack was released and included the song "I Got You Babe" by Khosla's band, Goldspot.</p><p>Khosla recently scored award-winning independent film thriller/mystery drama "The Sounding," from director Catherine Eaton starring Harris Yulin (Netflix' Ozark, Training Day, Scarface), Frankie Faison (HBO's The Wire), Erin Darke (AMC's Dietland), and Teddy Sears (Masters of Sex). The film won 17 awards including four Festival Grand Prizes, Best Actor prizes, Best Cinematography Awards, multiple Best Narrative Awards, etc. from festivals like Woodstock, Bend, Istanbul, Napa, Cinequest.</p><p>Khosla is currently scoring ABC's new Tim Doyle comedy series, "The Kids Are Alright," starring Michael Cudlitz and Mary McCormack. He also scores Hulu's original series, "Marvel's Runaways," and E!'s first scripted drama series, "The Royals," starring Elizabeth Hurley. Additionally, he composed original songs for the musical film "Basmati Blues," starring Academy Award-winner Brie Larson and Golden Globe Award-winner Donald Sutherland. Khosla recently scored CBS' comedy series "Me, Myself and I," starring John Larroquette and feature film comedy "Fat Camp," starring Chris Redd and Vivica A. Fox.</p><p>Khosla began scoring for television and film while fronting his acclaimed band, Goldspot, which was first discovered on KCRW's "Morning Becomes Eclectic." NPR described Goldspot as "An inventive sound and independent vision." The Sunday Times U.K. called it "the best band to come out of America in years." In 2013, the band's album "Aerogramme" captured #1 Album of the Year on the Los Angeles Times' pop music best albums list. Goldspot released three studio albums, including one with Mercury U.K./Universal Records, with hit singles reaching #10 in the U.K. radio charts, and #11 in the Alternative Charts. Goldspot's original songs have been featured on numerous TV shows, including "This Is Us," How I Met Your Mother," "The O.C." and "The Neighbors," as well as in major advertising campaigns for Google, Target and Apple.</p><p>Khosla's Indian-born parents came to the U.S. in the mid-seventies to make the American dream their own. With only eight dollars upon arrival, they were forced to take night jobs while they completed graduate school during the day. They had no choice but to send their toddler son back to India, where Khosla was raised by his grandparents. During this time, when international phone calls were prohibitively expensive, music became central to Khosla's life as he listened to his mother sing to him on cassette tapes she mailed from America. Khosla's song "Evergreen Cassette" is about this very experience, and was featured in the first season of "This is Us."</p><p>Khosla's love of music and connection to his Indian heritage were kept alive by his parents through the old Indian movie soundtracks they played in their home once he returned to the U.S. As a teenager, he embraced Western bands such as The Smiths, The Cure, The Beatles and Paul Simon. Today, his childhood experiences and musical roots inform his scores and songs to convey a sound that is engaging and unique. Khosla is a skilled multi-instrumentalist, and uses varied instrumentation on his scores from vintage electric and acoustic guitars, rare organs, orchestras, Eastern instruments like the harmonium and the Greek bouzouki, to Flemish harpsichords and vintage analog synthesizers.</p><p>In November 2013, Khosla was invited as the musical guest for First Lady Michelle Obama's Diwali celebration at the White House, where he delivered an emotional performance of several of his original songs.</p><p>Khosla has a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, where he composed and sang for the university's award-winning a cappella group, "Off the Beat." He now resides in Los Angeles with his wife and children.</p><p>Goldspot is a New York-based band. Founded by singer/songwriter/producer and television and film composer Siddhartha Khosla, the group has since received critical acclaim for its debut album Tally of the Yes Men (Tally), and second album And The Elephant is Dancing. The band released its third full-length, Aerogramme, on August 20, 2013.</p>Net Worth:<h3>Siddhartha Khosla Net Worth: $<span id=Total>100 Million</span></h3><b>Siddhartha Khosla's Income / Salary:</b><br><b>Per Year:</b> $<span id=Year>20 Million</span><p><b>Per Month:</b> $<span id=Month>2 Million</span></p><p><b>Per Week:</b> $<span id=Week>500,000</span></p><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><td><b>Per Day:</b></td><td><b>Per Hour:</b></td><td><b>Per Minute:</b></td><td><b>Per Second:</b></td></tr><tr><td>$<span id=Day>70,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Hour>3,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Minute>50</span></td><td>$<span id=Second>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Since you arrived on this page at <span id=CurrentTime></span>, Siddhartha Khosla Earned: <span id=earnNow></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmwp6KptW%2B6xK1ma2hhbXxyfY6hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZvKa%2FjKygnZyYlr%2B1tMBmoqGno6Gub7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
