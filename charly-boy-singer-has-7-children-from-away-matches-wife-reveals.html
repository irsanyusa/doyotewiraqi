Women everywhere. Charles is a charmer. He had 7kids from his away matches and the women he married that didn’t work out, before we got married. But as the years rolled by I found ways of calming him down, and curing my high blood pressure. I later found out that the women were more for his hypes and pons, like the charly’s virgins. One thing I knew from the beginning was that my husband always wanted to be a family man, after all he grew up seeing both parents together for sixty something years before papa passed on. Much later the women thing totally fizzled out. In the beginning I wasn’t too sure how to deal with all his children from deferent women, but trust charles he knows how to put his family together. That’s how I overnight became a mother of 9 children plus my last three. The only thing that he still does that pisses me off till tomorrow is his silence, when he is angry about something. He will lock himself in his room and may not talk to me for days. I can’t deal with that because we talk all the time our communication is on point. He always says he doesn’t want to say the wrong things when he is angry. Otherwise, Charles is the best thing to happen to me and I thank God for that."</p><p>When asked if her trust for him was ever shaken, she said,</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Yes, in the beginning the first maybe 8yrs, too many drama that I was dealing with. It wasn’t easy at all but I also matured along the way. I began to see things for what they really are not for what it looked like. Experience has thought me how to separate the boy Charly from my man Charles. Charly is an incorrigible botton pusher and that will never stop, but my man Charles is also an incorrigible introvert and that’s who I married. A few times he has reported himself to me and he is not good at lying. Being fulfilled in marriage is guaranteed when your spouse is supportive, understanding and sensitive to your feelings and most importantly, when he is always looking for creative ways to keep the fire burning."</p><p>Charly Boy had&nbsp;<a href=# id=a5fa96dd-ab20-5d5e-8f6c-a94f1f7ce3cb>earlier disclosed</a>&nbsp;he would be dishing out advice to couples in troubled marriages following Tiwa Savage and TeeBillz split.</p><p>Watch Pulse video below for more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGacoJGnubp5waiwZquZo7SmvoyhmKxlZ2KwqbXLnamepl2bv7C5jJqumrFdoq61r8eeqmavmZuybr7Er5yapKNksq6Cj7Btqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
