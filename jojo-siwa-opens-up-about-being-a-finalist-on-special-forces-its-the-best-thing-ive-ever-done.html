The celebrity opened up about what pushed her to join the grueling series and how she managed to make it all the way to the finale.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-was-invited-to-join-special-forces-season-one>JoJo Siwa Was Invited to Join Special Forces Season One</h2><p>JoJo Siwa has been ready to embrace herself in more mature, daring challenges beyond her usual kid-friendly entertainment persona. When she caught wind of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test</a>‘s first season, she was eager to test herself but didn’t make the cut. So, when producers invited her to compete in season two, she enthusiastically agreed despite some initial objections from her mother.</p><p>Within the season, fans can see the Siwa watching video messages recorded for her by her worried parents back home. Seeing their support, she admitted she crumbled into tears, deeply missing them, while also embracing her perseverance to remain in the competition, due to their encouragement.</p><p>“When I turned it on and saw it was my parents, I <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">crumbled</a>,” Siwa said. “I was picturing them getting the call of ‘we need you to make this video’… It’s real. I do miss them so much.”</p><p>Director Quarles has explained that Siwa stood out in the competition, due to her drive and initiative. Where other struggling celebrity recruits wavered or backed down, she stepped up to take charge. Quarles believed from early on that Siwa had the inner strength of a leader.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-recently-withdrew-from-the-competition>She Recently Withdrew From The Competition</h2><p>Just shy of being crowned the champion, Siwa has shocked viewers by withdrawing from Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test in the final episode. The 20-year-old celebrity recruit made it through nearly the entire grueling eight-day training course before deciding she had reached her personal limit.</p><p>Speaking to the media after her departure, Siwa explained that the stress and isolation of the final intensive interrogation simulation caused her to spiral into overthinking about her future. Realizing she urgently wanted to change the balance of priorities in her busy career, Siwa asked to speak to the on-site umpire overseeing the exercise.</p><p>At the moment, quitting felt like the right choice to initiate that lifestyle shift. Though normally highly competitive, Siwa said she held herself to too high and rigid of a standard about completing the challenges.</p><p>Rather than feeling regret over not toughing it out to the finale, Siwa has been proactive in implementing more balance between work and personal life. She even canceled an upcoming studio session to visit her mother instead of waiting weeks until their scheduled rendezvous.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Siwa</a> admitted recently slipping back into old habits by cutting a vacation short for a performance obligation. After experiencing a breakdown from stress, she then believes she has discovered a better rhythm and is dedicating more quality time to family and friends.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_KelseaBallerini_ChaseStokes_Taylor-HillWireImage-220x147.jpeg alt="Kelsea Ballerini Teases New Chase Stokes-Inspired Love Song: “You’ll Never Know How Much I Needed You”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaihqGWjnsSiec6pnKerXaq9bq3BqKytZZKatq%2BzjJpkn6Gelrmqv9Nmpqdlo6WypLXApWSfp6KYsrR5yK2qZqyYmnqjsdKtZK2gmaO0brXVnmSerpWneqW7zZ5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
