But are we truly unique in our love for the boiled herb drink?</h2><p>According to the latest YouGov EuroTrack study, Britons are not, in fact, the most likely tea drinkers on the continent. That honour goes to the Germans, of whom only 13% say they don’t drink tea. Britons come in third, behind Swedes (19%), with 22% of us saying we never have a drop.</p><p>The French (29%) and Danes (28%) are the most likely to say they don’t take tea.</p><p>Of course, there are many different types of tea, and Brits are far more likely to be drinking our own national blend – the English breakfast tea. Most Brits (54%) say that this is one of their teas of choice. Sweden are the next biggest breakfast tea drinkers at 35%, with 22% of Danes also fans. Just 15% of German and 13% of French adults drink English breakfast tea, however.</p><p>When looking across the channel to mainland Europe, Britain comparatively seems to have the least diverse taste in tea. After breakfast tea (54%), the most common teas amongst Brits are Earl Grey (18%) and Green tea (18%). In contrast, the country with the most diverse taste in tea is Germany, with seven different teas being drunk by more than a fifth of the population. The most popular tea drank in this country is peppermint (50%) closely followed by fruit tea (48%). Overall, the least popular tea across our Eurotrack countries seems to be Assam, a particular type of black tea named after its native Assam, India, with only 2%-14% of Europeans enjoying it.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/favourite20types20of20tea20Europe.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3><strong>Milk and sugar? Britons are the biggest fans of milk in their tea, while Germans have the sweetest tooth</strong></h3><p>When it comes to how drinkers of English breakfast and Earl Grey take their tea, Brits favour a milkier brew than their European counterparts. A massive 85% of British Earl Grey and English breakfast tea drinkers have their tea with milk. Brits are definitely in the minority here, with the next milkiest country being Sweden, where just 32% take their Earl Grey/English breakfast with milk. Danes and the French who sup these teas are the most likely to have them black, at 73% and 77% respectively.</p><p>Whilst Brits love a milky brew, Germans seem to have the sweetest taste when it comes to their cuppa, with 45% taking their Earl Grey or English breakfast with sugar, compared to only 23% of Swedes, the least likely to do so.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Britons20most20likely20to20prefer20milk20in.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Brits are however the most likely to use sweeteners in their tea in place of sugar (7%), with the French (1%) being the least likely. A sizeable number of Swedes (13%) say that they are adding honey and lemon to their Earl Grey/English breakfast.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/europe_tea_drinkers_sugar.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3><strong>British tea habits: women and older people are more likely to have a brew</strong></h3><p>In Britain specifically, taste in tea seems to vary by both gender and age. Women are overall more likely to drink tea, with only 19% saying they do not drink any type of tea compared to a quarter (25%) of men. While they are also more likely to drink breakfast tea compared to men (57% to 51%) they are more likely than men to deviate from this classic. Women are twice as likely as men to enjoy fruit tea (by 17% to 9%), herbal tea (by 17% to 8%), and peppermint tea (by 21% to 10%).</p><p>Younger Brits are the least likely to drink tea, with one third of 18-24 year olds (33%) answering they don’t drink tea at all, compared to just 19% of those aged over 65. Of those younger Brits who do drink tea, they are also the least likely Brits to drink English breakfast tea, with only 38% drinking English breakfast compared to 56-57% of older age groups.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/british_men_women_tea_types_drunk.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><strong>See results for GB <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p><strong>See results for Europe <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnY2h%2BeoCMoaawZZSkeqO%2ByK2grKBdqbKiecOroKejmaO0brTAm6Ctq12YvK68wKuc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
