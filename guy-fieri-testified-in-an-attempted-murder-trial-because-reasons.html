 The last place anybody might expect to see peroxided and spiky maned television chef Guy Fieri is on the witness stand at an attempted murder trial, but then again, nobody expected the reported brawl between him and his hairdresser, either.
Still, there he was in a courtroom in Marin County, Calif."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Wade was charged with the attempted murder of the couple and theft of the car, the <a href=#>Marin Independent Journal reported</a>.</p><p>The “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” host said in court that he did not know Wade and did not give him permission to give his $200,000 whip an unauthorized spin in March, 2011 — which he somehow kept for more than a year. Prosecutors say Wade stole the car in an attempt to impress the girl, Eva Dedier. On April 13, 2012, prosecutors say Wade rode up beside Dedier on a motorcycle and her then-paramour, Landon Wahlstrom and opened fire at them, but missed.</p><p>“I was pretty amazed,” Fieri told reporters outside of the court, explaining he was in Chicago when his vehicle was stolen. “You hear about cars getting stolen. You never hear about a car getting stolen from a dealership.”</p><p>And with that, he took the jury straight down to Flavor Town.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAp7HEnWWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWljZH5xe5JpZqCtqWKzqrHRomStnaOptqe1xJ1koqZdlrturdOtnKaopJqxbrnUq5ueql2pv6qty2aZnpuRqsCmedGemKynnqh8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
