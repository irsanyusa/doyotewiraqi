Do you think the traditional system is out of touch, or does it get the job done?</b></p><p>There are currently 786 members in the House of Lords. 671 of these are life peers, 90 are hereditary peers, and 26 are senior bishops from the Church of England, or ‘Lords Spiritual’. 600 of these are appointed.</p><p>There has been plenty of debate in and around Westminster with regards to altering the structure of the House of Lords – on whether to update it and make it more representative, or to retain its current workings. The push for reform is seen as a Liberal Democrat policy, yet politicians from all parties have spoken up on the issue.</p><p>Last month, <a href=#>YouGov's nationally-representative public opinion poll</a> found that 33% of the UK public favour a fully-elected chamber, while 41% would like to see a partially-elected chamber. Just 5% of the British public want a fully-<i>appointed</i> chamber.</p><p><b>We invited you to tell us which side of the House of Lords reform debate you stand. Should the House of Lords be entirely or partially-elected? Or should it remain as it is?</b></p><p><b>Most participants who responded thought that the Lords needed some kind of reform</b>.</p><p>Of these, most would opt for a fully-elected House of Lords, as opposed to a partially-elected one – but either way, most favoured dramatically increasing the public's say in who sits in the second chamber.</p><p>All-in-all, these participants believed that the current system was undemocratic, their logic being that anyone involved in the legislative process of governance should have some kind of accountability and legitimacy through elections.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/PA-last-chance_form.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Furthermore, they wanted representation in the second chamber – some of the remarks we received suggested that many felt current peers to be out of touch with modern life and in need of an update.</p><p>The main difference between participants who thought the house should be fully or partially elected rested on the role of specialist members with experience in certain fields – who might not be included in a fully elected house.</p><p>In comparison, those participants who argued the House of Lords <b>should remain as it is</b> pointed out that the current system is beneficial, in that it isn't necessarily involved with party politics – meaning that laws can be scrutinised impartially, and without the drama of the Commons – and for the wealth of experience held by specialised, appointed members.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/LabsLine.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h2><b><i>What are your views on reforming the House of Lords?
