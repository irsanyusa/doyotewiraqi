Stirling is apparently not spared from the stalking, and the scenario is reportedly putting her in a devastating position.</p><p>In a report published by TMZ, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seasoned musician</a> claimed that the stalker has been “making her life a living hell.” Thus, her immediate need to have the man captured.</p><p>Apparently, the stalker is not only interested in Stirling. The man has reportedly been engrossed with Taylor Swift too, for more than a year.</p><p>Stirling then hired a PI named Joe DeLu to solve the issue. In a mind-boggling encounter, the PI will confront the stalker to showcase how he irons out stalking incidents.</p><p>It might be a question why Stirling decided to employ a PI instead of the police. According to DeLu, there are several law enforcement agencies that elude in sending stay-away orders to stalkers due to fear of being attacked and harmed. Consequently, few to no people would want to address stalkers. This is where PIs enter the picture.</p><p>DeLu’s face-off with the alleged stalker will play on a new series on FOX titled TMZ Investigates: Obsessed and Dangerous: Hollywood’s Stalker Crisis. The program will air on Mondays at 9/8c.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-alleged-stalker-arrested-after-lurking-in-her-nyc-home>Taylor Swift’s Alleged Stalker Arrested After Lurking in Her NYC Home</h2><p>On Saturday, a man was arrested for allegedly for trying to break into Swift’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York City</a> apartment in Tribeca.

He didn’t resist. There was no yelling or anything,” the individual explained. “I first saw him around 1 p.m. — he went up to Taylor’s door. I’m not sure if he knocked or rang the doorbell.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Swift’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">neighbor</a> stated that the stalker also arrived at Swift’s house before Christmas, noting that her husband even confronted him.</p><p>“My husband asked what he was doing here, and he said, ‘I want to see Taylor,'” the source revealed. “He even had flowers at one point.”</p><p>The “Lover” singer was seen at Highmark Stadium in Buffalo, New York Sunday for the Kansas City Chiefs and her boyfriend Travis Kelce’s game against the Buffalo Bills.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Original_ZaynMalik_-Desiree-NavarroWireImage.jpg alt="Zayn Malik Got Run Over by a Car During Rare Appearance at Paris Fashion Show" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Lindsey Stirling</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>taylor swift</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y6KlnauVrnq0wMiro6Kml2K1qr7ErGSpoV2pvG6vwKmrrqqVYq6tuMSgnJ1lo6murbfEq2SloZ6gsqV506hkrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
