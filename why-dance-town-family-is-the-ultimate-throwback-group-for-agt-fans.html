Not only were fans able to see Dance Town Family in their full glory, they were also able to see a few other dance acts, all in one!</strong></p><p>In 2020, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dance Town Family</a> took the America’s Got Talent stage for the first time. At the time, it was revealed that Manny and his wife Lory Castro created Dance Town in 2003. They defined Dance Town as one of the most prestigious dance studios in the country.</p><p>Outside of this group, Manny and Lory produced other AGT groups like Miami All Stars (season 6), The Untouchables (season 7), Ruby and Jonas (season 8), and D’Angelo and Amanda (season 8). Since Dance Town Family is considered a “true” family affair, many of these family members are seen on stage in 2023, no matter their dance status.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-the-castros-up-to-in-2023>What Are The Castros Up to in 2023?</h2><p>During Monday night’s episode, Ruby Castro was definitely one of the most notable and eye catching members of Dance Town Family. Ruby made her TV debut with The Untouchables in season 7, at only 8 years old. A year later, she returned to the stage with partner Jonas Terleckas, as Ruby and Jonas.</p><p>After AGT, Ruby went on to compete on season 13 of So You Think You Can Dance. The dancer impressed, and even finished in sixth overall. In 2017, Ruby and Jonas competed on season two of World of Dance, but were eliminated in The Cut round. In current day, Ruby competes on a national scale with partner Vadym Pidhoretskyy.</p><p>Alongside Ruby in the world of dance is D’Angelo, who also first appeared as part of The Untouchables. In season 8, he returned to the AGT stage with his partner Amanda. Amanda was already known on national TV from her time on Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition, season one.</p><p>Following their journey on AGT, the couple competed on the first season of World of Dance. They were eliminated in the second round of the competition. D’Angelo later returned to World of Dance as part of The Untouchables.</p><p>In current day, D’Angelo is a Dancing With the Stars troupe member alongside Alexis Warr Burton, Ezra Sosa, and Kateryna Klishyna. He joined the dance troupe in 2022 as part of DWTS‘s season 31.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_NdlovuYouthChoir_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Everything to Know About The World Renowned Ndlovu Youth Choir on ‘AGT-All Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>agt</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGwZpyRo7CmedOorqdllpa6qrjYZqCsZaSdsm7By62gppmkmnq1tNGorpuZk6B6qL7Orqdmnp%2BneqKz02admqajZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
