Johnson, who previously won Season 8 with partner Mark Ballas, recently reunited with Hough to recreate some of their moves.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shawn-johnson-derek-hough-recreate-dwts-routines>Shawn Johnson, Derek Hough Recreate DWTS Routines</h2><p>Johnson and Hough recently posted videos on social media in which they hang out together and try to recreate some iconic moves from their time on DWTS. First up, they watched their Salsa routine and committed to recreating a move in which Johnson does a handstand.</p><p>Things didn’t go perfectly the first time they tried, as Johnson slipped a little bit in preparation for the move. But they tried it again, and they managed to do it. They even shared a split-screen to compare it to the original routine.</p><p>In another video, the pair watches a clip from their Samba routine and tries to recreate some cool hip and shoulder moves. They even recruited Johnson’s husband Andrew East to help them. The three of them did really well remembering the choreography.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FORMER ‘DWTS’ CELEBRITY SHAWN JOHNSON TRIES ON HER OLD COSTUMES</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-has-johnson-been-since-the-show>Where Has Johnson Been Since the Show?</h2><p>Johnson first competed on Season 8 of Dancing with the Stars with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">partner Mark Ballas</a>, winning the coveted Mirrorball trophy. She later returned for Season 15, which was an all-stars season. She and Hough placed second, behind winners Melissa Rycroft and Tony Dovolani.</p><p>The star is best known as a gymnast, having won a gold medal for the balance beam during the 2008 Olympics. In 2012, Johnson announced her retirement from gymnastics. Since then, she’s appeared on shows such as Celebrity Apprentice, The Challenge, and Family Feud.</p><p>Johnson married former football player Andrew East in 2016. The couple has two children together — a daughter named Drew Hazel and a son named Jett James. Johnson has also published a few books over the years, including a young adult novel called The Flip Side.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_NiallHoran_Joseph-OkpakoFilmMagic-220x146.jpeg alt="Revisiting Niall Horan’s Journey on ‘The X Factor UK’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w56pnqNdnby2s8dmqqGZp6N6q7vHp6qopl2nsqS%2BxJqrnmWknbKqvoydmKebmaO0bsPIrZ9mrJiaerTAwKuqZqqfqsGqusSsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
