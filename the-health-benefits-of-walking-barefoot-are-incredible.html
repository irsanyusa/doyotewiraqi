And when this happens, it improves our health in many ways.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Here are five health benefits of walking barefoot</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>1. It controls insomnia</h3></p><p>A study in PubMed revealed that walking barefoot influences physiologic processes as well as induces relaxation. It has also been shown that people who had been exposed to grounding have better sleep at night when compared with those who did not walk barefoot regularly.</p><p>The reason for this is because walking barefoot helps stabilize circadian rhythms, which is the first step to better sleep; as it is the internal system that's designed to regulate feelings of sleepiness and wakefulness over a 24-hour period.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>2. It controls blood pressure</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Recent studies have shown that the nerves of the feet are stimulated when we walk barefoot. And this usually leads to the reduction of stress levels. However, since stress is released through earthing, which is also known as walking barefoot, it helps in controlling the blood pressure.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>3. It boosts energy level</h3></p><p>Every lover nature knows that there is a higher energy in nature. This is why whenever you immerse yourself in the natural world, you pick up on the higher frequencies emitted from nature and therefore increase your own energy levels.</p><p>However, with our vitality constantly affected by modern society, it advisable for us to make out time to walk barefoot as often as we can.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>4. It helps to reduce chronic pain</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Alternative medicine practitioners affirm that the electrons present in the earth help enrich the immune system in our body. And this claim is backed by the findings of a recent study.</p><p>In addition to enriching the immune system, earthing increases the oxygen levels of the body and thus, helps reduce chronic or acute pain in our body.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-17>5. It improves overall posture</h3></p><p>A recent study has shown that shoes are having a negative effect on our feet. Our foot muscles are weaker than ever because of shoes and soft surfaces that don’t cause our feet to be flexible and strong like they once were.</p><p>This is one of the reasons for bad posture because we become reliant upon other muscles to do the job our feet are responsible for.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Our weak feet can lead to a bad posture which can lead to back pain, neck pain, and even knee pain which is actually often caused by shoes that misplace your postural alignment.</p><p>Note: Walking barefoot for 15 minutes every day is enough to provide the body with some of the mentioned health benefits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2BmrdStsGaglZa5tbSOrZ%2BeZZiarq3Ax2aZnqaVm7a1v4yonWavkaG4qrrGZpmaqpWbvLDAjJqpnmWZo7CzscOimaWdX6%2B4prGVbKo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
