In a new interview, fellow judge Luke Bryan reacted to Perry’s decision, saying it’s been “pretty awesome” to work with her for seven seasons.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-luke-bryan-reacts-to-katy-perry-leaving-american-idol>Luke Bryan Reacts to Katy Perry Leaving American Idol</h2><p>Luke Bryan recently talked to Katie Neal on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Audacy’s Totally Private</a>. During the conversation, he suggested that he wasn’t surprised by Katy Perry’s announcement that she’ll be leaving American Idol after this season.</p><p>“I thought she might be,” Bryan said. “And I feel that she’s been just a rock star on the show, and to have developed a friendship and then, you know, when you’re working alongside somebody like that, you gotta trust each other. You gotta help each other out on the rough days.”</p><p>He added that they’ve “had a great time together.” They didn’t know each other when they started on the show, but Bryan said that “to have spent so much time with her has been pretty awesome.” He called Perry “a trip.”</p><p>“For me to be a friend of hers, through her pregnancy, watching her grow into motherhood from start to finish, and just watching how sweet she is to Daisy,” Bryan said of their relationship. “It’s been a fun ride. I think she knows whenever she’s in Nashville to hit me up, and vice versa.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LUKE BRYAN HOOKED UP TO AN IV AS ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ AUDITIONS CONTINUE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryan-s-wife-gives-him-notes-on-his-judging>Bryan’s Wife Gives Him Notes on His Judging</h2><p>Bryan shared that his wife Caroline watches American Idol, and she doesn’t hesitate to give him “positive criticisms” on his performance as a judge on the show. As he said, “She’ll tell me where I got some things right and where I got some things wrong when I get home.”</p><p>The country singer admitted that he has a “nervous habit” of talking too much. However, in his time as a judge on Idol, he said he’s “learned to just shut up when I need to, and let somebody else step in the trap.”</p><p>Bryan also talked about how meaningful it is that American Idol takes the time to tell the contestants’ backstories, explaining, “A big thing about being an artist is people gotta know your story and what you’re about and where you’re from.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Original_SYTYCDJudges_Tom-Griscom_FOX-220x147.jpg alt="‘So You Think You Can Dance’ Season 18 Decides Top 8 Contestants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y66inmWSp8aiuoyrnJqbpKh6tbuMpJitsV2lsrO%2B2GajnpmmnruoecCmnKuhk5a7brXDqKNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
