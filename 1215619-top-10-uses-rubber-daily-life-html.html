Everything made out of rubber is waterproof, that’s why we make shoes, swimming caps, wetsuits for surfing etc.</p><p class=align-left>There are many types of rubber. Today, we are talking about natural rubber. Natural rubber is made out of a runny, white liquid, which is called latex. The main feature of such rubber is that its chains of molecules can be pulled apart and untangled fairly easily, but they spring straight back together as you release them. That is the reason for rubber to be elastic.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/66749d0baa3140e0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 of the best beach quotes and puns to use for your Instagram caption</span></p></a><h3>What are the uses of rubber in our daily life?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/66749d0baa3140e0.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Christmas decorations- Best DIY ideas</p><p class=align-left>As we are here to talk about the uses of natural rubber (and elastic rubber bands in particular), let’s take a look at some variations of them.

If your eraser is nowhere to be seen, but you have a few rubber bands lying around, you can use them instead. All you need to do is to make a rubber band ball, for doing this, just wrap several rubbers around a golf or tennis ball and that is all. Now you can use this ball as an eraser.</li><li><strong>Prevent browning.</strong> Have you ever faced such problem as that awful brown color of a fruit or vegetables. To prevent that, next time you slice up an apple, just put it back together, secured with a band and it won’t get brown then. It is a perfect way to save a product for later, if you are, for example, packing a lunch or dinner with apple slices.</li><li><strong>Portion control.</strong> We’re sure you know that feeling when someone has a heavy hand while using the products with a pump dispenser, for example, shampoo, hand soap, body lotion, conditioner etc. The rubber can help you in this situation. All you have to do is simply wrap a rubber band around the pump a few times, try to control how much comes out. And that’s it. Now you don’t have to spend more product than you actually need.</li><li><strong>Tying up loose ends</strong>. That’s the most common way to use the rubber. We are sure you know that, but let us still remind you. Just put one rubber band around the thing, which you think can be unraveled, for example, spools of ribbon, electrical cords or measuring tape.</li><li><strong>Lid gripper.</strong> Everyone in this world has struggled at least once with opening a jar of pickles. Especially when you do not have much strength in your arms. And here is the solution to your troubles. You can simply wrap a wide rubber band around the rim of a lid and twist it. It will help you to open this jar.</li><li><strong>Drink marker.</strong> A lot of people like parties. But the synonym to the word “party” is “a mess”. There are usually a lot of people, food, drinks, and the main problem in all that is the possibility to confuse what drink is yours. That’s the case, when you can use a rubber band. Simply wrap one around your cup and you will always see where exactly your drink is.</li><li><strong>Anti-slipping. </strong>If you have anything in your house that has a tendency to slip, simply add a rubber band to the object and the problem is solved.</li><li><strong>In case you are a book worm. </strong>There are two variants to use a rubber for people who love reading. The first one is to use it as a bookmark. And the second is just wrap a rubber band around the cover. That will keep your book from opening and pages from creasing.</li><li><strong>Mail divider.</strong> At first you should start with a cabinet or shelf. Just hammer some nails about five inches from the side. Then you can stretch the rubber bands between these nails to keep papers or mail from falling over.</li><li><strong>Paint drip preventer.</strong> Wrap a big rubber band, top it to the bottom around an open paint can. Use it instead of wiping the paintbrush on the edge of the can.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5cc46bc833e41b31.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Learn how to clean washing machine in a surprisingly easy way</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As you may notice, all these tips with using rubber bands mostly work for organizing stuff.
